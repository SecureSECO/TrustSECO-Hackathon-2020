Exposes a **stream API** and a **promise API**.\n\n\n```sh\nnpm install readdirp\n```\n\n```javascript\nconst readdirp = require('readdirp');\n\n// Use streams to achieve small RAM & CPU footprint.\n// 1) Streams example with for-await.\nfor await (const entry of readdirp('.')) {\n  const {path} = entry;\n  console.log(`${JSON.stringify({path})}`);\n}\n\n// 2) Streams example, non for-await.\n// Print out all JS files along with their size within the current folder & subfolders.\nreaddirp('.', {fileFilter: '*.js', alwaysStat: true})\n  .on('data', (entry) => {\n    const {path, stats: {size}} = entry;\n    console.log(`${JSON.stringify({path, size})}`);\n  })\n  // Optionally call stream.destroy() in `warn()` in order to abort and cause 'close' to be emitted\n  .on('warn', error => console.error('non-fatal error', error))\n  .on('error', error => console.error('fatal error', error))\n  .on('end', () => console.log('done'));\n\n// 3) Promise example. More RAM and CPU than streams / for-await.\nconst files = await readdirp.promise('.');\nconsole.log(files.map(file => file.path));\n\n// Other options.\nreaddirp('test', {\n  fileFilter: '*.js',\n  directoryFilter: ['!.git', '!*modules']\n  // directoryFilter: (di) => di.basename.length === 9\n  type: 'files_directories',\n  depth: 1\n});\n```\n\nFor more examples, check out `examples` directory.\n\n## API\n\n`const stream = readdirp(root[, options])` — **Stream API**\n\n- Reads given root recursively and returns a `stream` of [entry infos](#entryinfo)\n- Optionally can be used like `for await (const entry of stream)` with node.js 10+ (`asyncIterator`).\n- `on('data', (entry) => {})` [entry info](#entryinfo) for every file / dir.\n- `on('warn', (error) => {})` non-fatal `Error` that prevents a file / dir from being processed. Example: inaccessible to the user.\n- `on('error', (error) => {})` fatal `Error` which also ends the stream. Example: illegal options where passed.\n- `on('end')` — we are done. Called when all entries were found and no more will be emitted.\n- `on('close')` — stream is destroyed via `stream.destroy()`.\n  Could be useful if you want to manually abort even on a non fatal error.\n  At that point the stream is no longer `readable` and no more entries, warning or errors are emitted\n- To learn more about streams, consult the very detailed [nodejs streams documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html)\n  or the [stream-handbook](https://github.com/substack/stream-handbook)\n\n`const entries = await readdirp.promise(root[, options])` — **Promise API**. Returns a list of [entry infos](#entryinfo).\n\nFirst argument is awalys `root`, path in which to start reading and recursing into subdirectories.\n\n### options\n\n- `fileFilter: [\"*.js\"]`: filter to include or exclude files. A `Function`, Glob string or Array of glob strings.\n    - **Function**: a function that takes an entry info as a parameter and returns true to include or false to exclude the entry\n    - **Glob string**: a string (e.g., `*.js`) which is matched using [picomatch](https://github.com/micromatch/picomatch), so go there for more\n        information. Globstars (`**`) are not supported since specifying a recursive pattern for an already recursive function doesn't make sense. Negated globs (as explained in the minimatch documentation) are allowed, e.g., `!*.txt` matches everything but text files.\n    - **Array of glob strings**: either need to be all inclusive or all exclusive (negated) patterns otherwise an error is thrown.\n        `['*.json', '*.js']` includes all JavaScript and Json files.\n        `['!.git', '!node_modules']` includes all directories except the '.git' and 'node_modules'.\n    - Directories that do not pass a filter will not be recursed into.\n- `directoryFilter: ['!.git']`: filter to include/exclude directories found and to recurse into. Directories that do not pass a filter will not be recursed into.\n- `depth: 5`: depth at which to stop recursing even if more subdirectories are found\n- `type: 'files'`: determines if data events on the stream should be emitted for `'files'` (default), `'directories'`, `'files_directories'`, or `'all'`. Setting to `'all'` will also include entries for other types of file descriptors like character devices, unix sockets and named pipes.\n- `alwaysStat: false`: always return `stats` property for every file. Default is `false`, readdirp will return `Dirent` entries. Setting it to `true` can double readdir execution time - use it only when you need file `size`, `mtime` etc. Cannot be enabled on node <10.10.0.\n- `lstat: false`: include symlink entries in the stream along with files. When `true`, `fs.lstat` would be used instead of `fs.stat`\n\n### `EntryInfo`\n\nHas the following properties:\n\n- `path: 'assets/javascripts/react.js'`: path to the file/directory (relative to given root)\n- `fullPath: '/Users/dev/projects/app/assets/javascripts/react.js'`: full path to the file/directory found\n- `basename: 'react.js'`: name of the file/directory\n- `dirent: fs.Dirent`: built-in [dir entry object](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_dirent) - only with `alwaysStat: false`\n- `stats: fs.Stats`: built in [stat object](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats) - only with `alwaysStat: true`\n\n## Changelog\n\n- 3.5 (Oct 13, 2020) disallows recursive directory-based symlinks.\n  Before, it could have entered infinite loop.\n- 3.4 (Mar 19, 2020) adds support for directory-based symlinks.\n- 3.3 (Dec 6, 2019) stabilizes RAM consumption and enables perf management with `highWaterMark` option. Fixes race conditions related to `for-await` looping.\n- 3.2 (Oct 14, 2019) improves performance by 250% and makes streams implementation more idiomatic.\n- 3.1 (Jul 7, 2019) brings `bigint` support to `stat` output on Windows. This is backwards-incompatible for some cases. Be careful. It you use it incorrectly, you'll see \"TypeError: Cannot mix BigInt and other types, use explicit conversions\".\n- 3.0 brings huge performance improvements and stream backpressure support.\n- Upgrading 2.x to 3.x:\n    - Signature changed from `readdirp(options)` to `readdirp(root, options)`\n    - Replaced callback API with promise API.\n    - Renamed `entryType` option to `type`\n    - Renamed `entryType: 'both'` to `'files_directories'`\n    - `EntryInfo`\n        - Renamed `stat` to `stats`\n            - Emitted only when `alwaysStat: true`\n            - `dirent` is emitted instead of `stats` by default with `alwaysStat: false`\n        - Renamed `name` to `basename`\n        - Removed `parentDir` and `fullParentDir` properties\n- Supported node.js versions:\n    - 3.x: node 8+\n    - 2.x: node 0.6+\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) 2012-2019 Thorsten Lorenz, Paul Miller (<https://paulmillr.com>)\n\nMIT License, see [LICENSE](LICENSE)
