When there are identical properties, the right-most property takes precedence.\n\n## Examples\n\n```js\nvar extend = require(\"xtend\")\n\n// extend returns a new object. Does not mutate arguments\nvar combination = extend({\n    a: \"a\",\n    b: \"c\"\n}, {\n    b: \"b\"\n})\n// { a: \"a\", b: \"b\" }\n```\n\n## Stability status: Locked\n\n## MIT Licensed \n\n\n  [3]: http://ci.testling.com/Raynos/xtend.png\n  [4]: http://ci.testling.com/Raynos/xtend\n","homepage":"https://github.com/Raynos/xtend","trustScore":27,"sourceRank":{"basic_info_present":1,"repository_present":1,"readme_present":1,"license_present":1,"versions_present":1,"follows_semver":1,"recent_release":0,"not_brand_new":1,"one_point_oh":1,"dependent_projects":8,"dependent_repositories":6,"stars":2,"contributors":1,"subscribers":2,"all_prereleases":0,"any_outdated_dependencies":0,"is_deprecated":0,"is_unmaintained":0,"is_removed":0,"trustScore":27},"versions":[{"versionNumber":"1.0.0","timestamp":"2012-05-23T11:25:21.192Z","trustScore":13,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.1","timestamp":"2012-05-23T11:27:39.720Z","trustScore":14,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.2","timestamp":"2012-05-23T11:28:40.032Z","trustScore":14,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.3","timestamp":"2012-05-30T12:03:49.948Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.1","timestamp":"2013-03-02T02:52:08.771Z","trustScore":13,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.2","timestamp":"2013-03-02T02:53:05.996Z","trustScore":12,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.3","timestamp":"2013-03-02T02:56:11.023Z","trustScore":12,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.4","timestamp":"2013-05-15T21:04:12.697Z","trustScore":12,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"is-object","version":"~0.1.2"},{"packageName":"object-keys","version":"~0.2.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.5","timestamp":"2013-06-01T23:27:01.096Z","trustScore":13,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"is-object","version":"~0.1.2"},{"packageName":"object-keys","version":"~0.2.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.6","timestamp":"2013-06-20T21:30:21.949Z","trustScore":13,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"is-object","version":"~0.1.2"},{"packageName":"object-keys","version":"~0.2.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"2.1.1","timestamp":"2013-09-04T17:17:38.531Z","trustScore":12,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"object-keys","version":"~0.4.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"2.1.2","timestamp":"2014-01-01T09:31:13.601Z","trustScore":13,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"object-keys","version":"~0.4.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"2.2.0","timestamp":"2014-03-26T08:35:47.006Z","trustScore":12,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"3.0.0","timestamp":"2014-04-14T20:35:30.623Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"4.0.0","timestamp":"2014-07-31T22:23:46.567Z","trustScore":13,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"4.0.1","timestamp":"2015-11-02T22:19:21.923Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"4.0.2","timestamp":"2019-07-08T13:35:45.491Z","trustScore":27,"dependencies":[]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
