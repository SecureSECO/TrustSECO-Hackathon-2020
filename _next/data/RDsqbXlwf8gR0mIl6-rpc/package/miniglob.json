Instead, '\\\\' is treated as path separator.\n\n","homepage":"https://github.com/rsms/js-miniglob#readme","trustScore":8,"sourceRank":{"basic_info_present":1,"repository_present":1,"readme_present":1,"license_present":1,"versions_present":1,"follows_semver":1,"recent_release":0,"not_brand_new":1,"one_point_oh":0,"dependent_projects":0,"dependent_repositories":0,"stars":1,"contributors":0,"subscribers":0,"all_prereleases":0,"any_outdated_dependencies":0,"is_deprecated":0,"is_unmaintained":0,"is_removed":0,"trustScore":8},"versions":[{"versionNumber":"0.1.0","timestamp":"2018-07-22T01:55:01.721Z","trustScore":4,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.1","timestamp":"2018-07-22T23:47:24.626Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
