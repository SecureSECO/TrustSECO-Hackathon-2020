Passes an error argument if there was an error.\n```js\nvar kill = require('tree-kill');\nkill(1, 'SIGKILL', function(err) {\n    // Do things\n});\n```\n\nYou can also install tree-kill globally and use it as a command:\n```sh\ntree-kill 1          # sends SIGTERM to process 1 and its descendents\ntree-kill 1 SIGTERM  # same\ntree-kill 1 SIGKILL  # sends KILL instead of TERMINATE\n```\n\nMethods\n=======\n\n## require('tree-kill')(pid, [signal], [callback]);\n\nSends signal `signal` to all children processes of the process with pid `pid`, including `pid`. Signal defaults to `SIGTERM`.\n\nFor Linux, this uses `ps -o pid --no-headers --ppid PID` to find the parent pids of `PID`.\n\nFor Darwin/OSX, this uses `pgrep -P PID` to find the parent pids of `PID`.\n\nFor Windows, this uses `'taskkill /pid PID /T /F'` to kill the process tree. Note that on Windows, sending the different kinds of POSIX signals is not possible.\n\nInstall\n=======\n\nWith [npm](https://npmjs.org) do:\n\n```\nnpm install tree-kill\n```\n\nLicense\n=======\n\nMIT\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\n\n## [1.2.2] - 2019-12-11\n### Changed\n- security fix: sanitize `pid` parameter to fix arbitrary code execution vulnerability\n\n## [1.2.1] - 2018-11-05\n### Changed\n- added missing LICENSE file\n- updated TypeScript definitions\n\n## [1.2.0] - 2017-09-19\n### Added\n- TypeScript definitions\n### Changed\n- `kill(pid, callback)` works.
