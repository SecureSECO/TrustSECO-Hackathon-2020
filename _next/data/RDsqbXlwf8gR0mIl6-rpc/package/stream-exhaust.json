It is a separate package because it has\ndifferent semantics:\n\n1. It does not call `.resume()` on streams2+ streams. streams2 streams monkeypatch `.pipe`\nwhen entering flowing mode; avoiding `resume()` avoids that fate.\n2. It does not examine `._readableState`; instead it checks for the presence of `._read`.\n\n## API\n\n### exhaust(Stream s) -> Stream s\n\nTakes a stream, `s`, and returns it. Ensures that the stream is flowing, either by calling\n`.resume()` if the stream is a streams1 stream, or by piping it to a \"black hole\" stream that\ncontinually asks for more data.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n","homepage":"https://github.com/chrisdickinson/stream-exhaust.git","trustScore":16,"sourceRank":{"basic_info_present":1,"repository_present":1,"readme_present":1,"license_present":1,"versions_present":1,"follows_semver":1,"recent_release":0,"not_brand_new":1,"one_point_oh":1,"dependent_projects":2,"dependent_repositories":4,"stars":1,"contributors":0,"subscribers":1,"all_prereleases":0,"any_outdated_dependencies":0,"is_deprecated":0,"is_unmaintained":0,"is_removed":0,"trustScore":16},"versions":[{"versionNumber":"1.0.0","timestamp":"2014-08-22T07:01:51.090Z","trustScore":7,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.1","timestamp":"2015-01-19T00:43:31.174Z","trustScore":7,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.2","timestamp":"2017-08-30T06:13:54.801Z","trustScore":16,"dependencies":[]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
