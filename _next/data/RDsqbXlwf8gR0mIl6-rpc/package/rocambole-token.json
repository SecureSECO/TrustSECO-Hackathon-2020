It's *better* to write a separate tool to\n*sanitize* this info and that can be executed as a separate step.\n\nAlso important to note that right now rocambole doesn't add any reference on\nthe token itself to the nodes that contain that token, so if you remove a token\nthat happens to be the `startToken` or `endToken` of any node you might have\nsome conflict if you start manipulating the tokens based on the `nodes`,\ninstead of the `token` LinkedList. - the `node.startToken` might be *detached*\nfrom the LinkedList.\n\nTest coverage is pretty low so far, but since it was mostly extracted from\nesformatter the methods should work as expected. I started to write some tests\njust to show how I would do it but did not had the time to finish it...\n(ideally tests should be written before the implementation).\n\n\n## License\n\nReleased under the MIT License.\n\n","homepage":"https://github.com/millermedeiros/rocambole-token","trustScore":17,"sourceRank":{"basic_info_present":1,"repository_present":1,"readme_present":1,"license_present":1,"versions_present":1,"follows_semver":1,"recent_release":0,"not_brand_new":1,"one_point_oh":1,"dependent_projects":4,"dependent_repositories":3,"stars":1,"contributors":0,"subscribers":1,"all_prereleases":0,"any_outdated_dependencies":0,"is_deprecated":0,"is_unmaintained":0,"is_removed":0,"trustScore":17},"versions":[{"versionNumber":"1.0.0","timestamp":"2013-12-10T18:33:41.446Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.1.0","timestamp":"2013-12-17T14:04:13.122Z","trustScore":7,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.1.1","timestamp":"2014-06-17T12:16:00.515Z","trustScore":7,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.1.2","timestamp":"2014-06-28T17:25:06.249Z","trustScore":7,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.2.0","timestamp":"2014-07-02T21:51:28.737Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.2.1","timestamp":"2014-07-02T21:54:45.264Z","trustScore":17,"dependencies":[]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
