For example,\nyou can run Node.js 32-bit on a 64-bit OS. In that situation, `os.arch()` will\nreturn a misleading 'x86' (32-bit) value, instead of 'x64' (64-bit).\n\nUse this package to get the actual operating system CPU architecture.\n\n**BONUS: This package works in the browser too.**\n\n## install\n\n```\nnpm install arch\n```\n\n## usage\n\n```js\nvar arch = require('arch')\nconsole.log(arch()) // always returns 'x64' or 'x86'\n```\n\nIn the browser, there is no spec that defines where this information lives, so we\ncheck all known locations including `navigator.userAgent`, `navigator.platform`,\nand `navigator.cpuClass` to make a best guess.\n\nIf there is no *affirmative indication* that the architecture is 64-bit, then\n32-bit will be assumed. This makes this package perfect for determining what\ninstaller executable to offer to desktop app users. If there is ambiguity, then\nthe user will get the 32-bit installer, which will work fine even for a user with\na 64-bit OS.\n\nFor reference, `x64` means 64-bit and `x86` means 32-bit.\n\nHere is some history behind these naming conventions:\n\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IA-32\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64\n\n## Node.js proposal - `os.sysarch()`\n\nNote: There is\n[a proposal](https://github.com/nodejs/node-v0.x-archive/issues/2862#issuecomment-103942051)\nto add this functionality to Node.js as `os.sysarch()`.\n\n## license\n\nMIT.
