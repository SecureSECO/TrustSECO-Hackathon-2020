The first, and obvious reason is that node.js is asynchronous, and therefore our tests need to be. The second reason is to make test suites which target I/O libraries run much faster.\n\n_Vows_ is an experiment in making this possible, while adding a minimum of overhead.\n\nsynopsis\n--------\n\n```js\nvar vows = require('vows'),\n    assert = require('assert');\n\nvows.describe('Deep Thought').addBatch({\n    'An instance of DeepThought': {\n        topic: new DeepThought,\n\n        'should know the answer to the ultimate question of life': function (deepThought) {\n            assert.equal (deepThought.question('what is the answer to the universe?'), 42);\n        }\n    }\n});\n```\n\ncoverage reporting\n------------------\nCode coverage reporting is available if _instrumented_ code is detected.  Currently only _instrumentation_ via [node-jscoverage](https://github.com/visionmedia/node-jscoverage) is supported.  When _instrumented_ code is detected and coverage reporting is enabled using any of the `--cover-plain`, `--cover-html`, or `--cover-json` options a code coverage map is generated.\n\n### downloading and installing [node-jscoverage](https://github.com/visionmedia/node-jscoverage)\n[node-jscoverage](https://github.com/visionmedia/node-jscoverage) is a binary package that needs to be compiled from source:\n\n```sh\n$ git clone https://github.com/visionmedia/node-jscoverage.git\n$ cd node-jscoverage/\n$ ./configure\nchecking for a BSD-compatible install... /usr/bin/install -c\nchecking whether build environment is sane... yes\n[...]\n$ make && sudo make install\n```\n\n### instrumenting with jscoverage\n\n```sh\n$ jscoverage myfile.js myfile-instrumented.js\n```\n\ninstallation\n------------\n\n```sh\n$ npm install vows\n```\n\ndocumentation\n-------------\n\nHead over to <http://vowsjs.org>\n\nrun tests\n-------------\n\n```sh\n$ npm test\n```\n\nauthors\n-------\n\n[Alexis Sellier](https://github.com/cloudhead), [Charlie Robbins](https://github.com/indexzero), [Jerry Sievert](https://github.com/jerrysievert)\n\n*...and many
