This can be combined with a module like\n[pkg-conf](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pkg-conf) to, _as if by magic_, load\ntop-level configuration.\n\nUnfortunately, `require.main.filename` sometimes fails when an application is\nexecuted with an alternative process manager, e.g., [iisnode](https://github.com/tjanczuk/iisnode).\n\n`require-main-filename` is a shim that addresses this problem.\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nvar main = require('require-main-filename')()\n// use main as an alternative to require.main.filename.\n```\n\n## License\n\nISC\n","homepage":"https://github.com/yargs/require-main-filename#readme","trustScore":22,"sourceRank":{"basic_info_present":1,"repository_present":1,"readme_present":1,"license_present":1,"versions_present":1,"follows_semver":1,"recent_release":0,"not_brand_new":1,"one_point_oh":1,"dependent_projects":4,"dependent_repositories":6,"stars":1,"contributors":1,"subscribers":2,"all_prereleases":0,"any_outdated_dependencies":0,"is_deprecated":0,"is_unmaintained":0,"is_removed":0,"trustScore":22},"versions":[{"versionNumber":"1.0.0","timestamp":"2016-02-01T05:57:45.801Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.1","timestamp":"2016-02-17T05:54:56.900Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.0","timestamp":"2019-01-28T19:42:56.566Z","trustScore":22,"dependencies":[]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
