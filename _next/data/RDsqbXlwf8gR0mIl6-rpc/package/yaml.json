{"pageProps":{"postData":{"_id":"5fb6652c9f9e7f16fd32475e","id":"yaml","crawlTimestamp":"19/11/2020 12:29:31","packageName":"yaml","description":"JavaScript parser and stringifier for YAML","repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/eemeli/yaml.git"},"readme":"# YAML <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/yaml\"><img align=\"right\" src=\"https://badge.fury.io/js/yaml.svg\" title=\"npm package\" /></a>\n\n`yaml` is a JavaScript parser and stringifier for [YAML](http://yaml.org/), a human friendly data serialization standard. It supports both parsing and stringifying data using all versions of YAML, along with all common data schemas. As a particularly distinguishing feature, `yaml` fully supports reading and writing comments and blank lines in YAML documents.\n\nThe library is released under the ISC open source license, and the code is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/eemeli/yaml/). It has no external dependencies and runs on Node.js 6 and later, and in browsers from IE 11 upwards.\n\nFor the purposes of versioning, any changes that break any of the endpoints or APIs documented here will be considered semver-major breaking changes. Undocumented library internals may change between minor versions, and previous APIs may be deprecated (but not removed).\n\nFor more information, see the project's documentation site: [**eemeli.org/yaml**](https://eemeli.org/yaml/)\n\nTo install:\n\n```sh\nnpm install yaml@next\n```\n\n**Note:** These docs are for `yaml@2`. For v1, see the [v1.10.0 tag](https://github.com/eemeli/yaml/tree/v1.10.0) for the source and [eemeli.org/yaml/v1](https://eemeli.org/yaml/v1/) for the documentation.\n\n## API Overview\n\nThe API provided by `yaml` has three layers, depending on how deep you need to go: [Parse & Stringify](https://eemeli.org/yaml/#parse-amp-stringify), [Documents](https://eemeli.org/yaml/#documents), and the [CST Parser](https://eemeli.org/yaml/#cst-parser). The first has the simplest API and \"just works\", the second gets you all the bells and whistles supported by the library along with a decent [AST](https://eemeli.org/yaml/#content-nodes), and the third is the closest to YAML source, making it fast, raw, and crude.\n\n```js\nimport YAML from 'yaml'\n// or\nconst YAML = require('yaml')\n```\n\n### Parse & Stringify\n\n- [`YAML.parse(str, reviver?, options?): value`](https://eemeli.org/yaml/#yaml-parse)\n- [`YAML.stringify(value, replacer?, options?): string`](https://eemeli.org/yaml/#yaml-stringify)\n\n### YAML Documents\n\n- [`YAML.defaultOptions`](https://eemeli.org/yaml/#options)\n- [`YAML.Document`](https://eemeli.org/yaml/#yaml-documents)\n  - [`constructor(value, replacer?, options?)`](https://eemeli.org/yaml/#creating-documents)\n  - [`defaults`](https://eemeli.org/yaml/#options)\n  - [`#createNode(value, options?): Node`](https://eemeli.org/yaml/#creating-nodes)\n  - [`#anchors`](https://eemeli.org/yaml/#working-with-anchors)\n  - [`#contents`](https://eemeli.org/yaml/#content-nodes)\n  - [`#errors`](https://eemeli.org/yaml/#errors)\n- [`YAML.parseAllDocuments(str, options?): YAML.Document[]`](https://eemeli.org/yaml/#parsing-documents)\n- [`YAML.parseDocument(str, options?): YAML.Document`](https://eemeli.org/yaml/#parsing-documents)\n\n```js\nimport { Pair, YAMLMap, YAMLSeq } from 'yaml/types'\n```\n\n- [`new Pair(key, value)`](https://eemeli.org/yaml/#creating-nodes)\n- [`new YAMLMap()`](https://eemeli.org/yaml/#creating-nodes)\n- [`new YAMLSeq()`](https://eemeli.org/yaml/#creating-nodes)\n\n### CST Parser\n\n```js\nimport parseCST from 'yaml/parse-cst'\n```\n\n- [`parseCST(str): CSTDocument[]`](https://eemeli.org/yaml/#parsecst)\n- [`YAML.parseCST(str): CSTDocument[]`](https://eemeli.org/yaml/#parsecst)\n\n## YAML.parse\n\n```yaml\n# file.yml\nYAML:\n  - A
