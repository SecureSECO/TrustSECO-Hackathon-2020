Just clone this repository and install the dependencies:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/square/find-yarn-workspace-root.git\ncd find-yarn-workspace-root\nyarn\n```\n\nNote that you'll need `node` and `yarn` installed. Next, verify the tests all pass:\n\n```bash\nyarn test\n```\n\nThen create a branch for your bugfix/feature, make changes and update the tests, and submit a pull request. Please do not change the version in `package.json` when submitting a pull request. We determine the next version automatically based on the commits since the last release.\n\n> *NOTE*: Commit messages follow the [Angular commit message guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#commits).\n\n## Releases\n\nReleases are handled by Travis CI once a build succeeds on `master`. To trigger a release, bump the version using `standard-version`:\n\n```bash\n$(yarn bin)/standard-version\n```\n\nThat should update the CHANGELOG, bump the version in `package.json`, and create a git tag. Then, just `git push && git push --tags`.\n\n---\nCopyright 2017 Square, Inc.\n","homepage":"https://github.com/bluelovers/ws-yarn-workspaces/tree/master/packages/find-yarn-workspace-root2#readme","trustScore":11,"sourceRank":{"basic_info_present":1,"repository_present":1,"readme_present":1,"license_present":1,"versions_present":1,"follows_semver":1,"recent_release":1,"not_brand_new":1,"one_point_oh":1,"dependent_projects":2,"dependent_repositories":1,"stars":0,"contributors":0,"subscribers":0,"all_prereleases":0,"any_outdated_dependencies":-1,"is_deprecated":0,"is_unmaintained":0,"is_removed":0,"trustScore":11},"versions":[{"versionNumber":"1.2.1","timestamp":"2019-05-07T10:16:49.143Z","trustScore":4,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"micromatch","version":"^4.0.2"},{"packageName":"pkg-dir","version":"^4.1.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.2.2","timestamp":"2019-05-07T11:00:46.282Z","trustScore":5,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"micromatch","version":"^4.0.2"},{"packageName":"pkg-dir","version":"^4.1.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.2.3","timestamp":"2019-05-31T18:23:52.493Z","trustScore":5,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"micromatch","version":"^4.0.2"},{"packageName":"pkg-dir","version":"^4.2.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.2.4","timestamp":"2019-05-31T19:26:24.359Z","trustScore":5,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"micromatch","version":"^4.0.2"},{"packageName":"pkg-dir","version":"^4.2.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.2.5","timestamp":"2019-05-31T19:52:34.636Z","trustScore":5,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"micromatch","version":"^4.0.2"},{"packageName":"pkg-dir","version":"^4.2.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.2.6","timestamp":"2019-06-04T12:11:20.789Z","trustScore":4,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"micromatch","version":"^4.0.2"},{"packageName":"pkg-dir","version":"^4.2.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.2.7","timestamp":"2020-01-06T13:38:00.447Z","trustScore":7,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"micromatch","version":"^4.0.2"},{"packageName":"pkg-dir","version":"^4.2.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.2.8","timestamp":"2020-04-04T22:29:15.182Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"micromatch","version":"^4.0.2"},{"packageName":"pkg-dir","version":"^4.2.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.2.10","timestamp":"2020-04-05T23:06:34.262Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"micromatch","version":"^4.0.2"},{"packageName":"pkg-dir","version":"^4.2.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.2.11","timestamp":"2020-04-06T05:43:22.191Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"micromatch","version":"^4.0.2"},{"packageName":"pkg-dir","version":"^4.2.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.2.12","timestamp":"2020-05-10T15:38:59.916Z","trustScore":12,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"micromatch","version":"^4.0.2"},{"packageName":"pkg-dir","version":"^4.2.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.2.13","timestamp":"2020-05-23T16:04:32.163Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"micromatch","version":"^4.0.2"},{"packageName":"pkg-dir","version":"^4.2.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.2.14","timestamp":"2020-06-06T18:12:06.463Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"micromatch","version":"^4.0.2"},{"packageName":"pkg-dir","version":"^4.2.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.2.15","timestamp":"2020-06-06T20:10:19.397Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"micromatch","version":"^4.0.2"},{"packageName":"pkg-dir","version":"^4.2.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.2.16","timestamp":"2020-06-11T22:38:23.578Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"micromatch","version":"^4.0.2"},{"packageName":"pkg-dir","version":"^4.2.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.2.18","timestamp":"2020-06-19T22:38:18.109Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"micromatch","version":"^4.0.2"},{"packageName":"pkg-dir","version":"^4.2.0"},{"packageName":"upath2","version":"^3.0.6"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.2.19","timestamp":"2020-06-20T06:47:19.635Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"micromatch","version":"^4.0.2"},{"packageName":"pkg-dir","version":"^4.2.0"},{"packageName":"upath2","version":"^3.0.6"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.2.20","timestamp":"2020-06-23T15:23:03.055Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"micromatch","version":"^4.0.2"},{"packageName":"pkg-dir","version":"^4.2.0"},{"packageName":"upath2","version":"^3.0.6"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.2.21","timestamp":"2020-06-27T04:10:56.433Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"micromatch","version":"^4.0.2"},{"packageName":"pkg-dir","version":"^4.2.0"},{"packageName":"upath2","version":"^3.1.4"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.2.22","timestamp":"2020-07-05T12:21:01.772Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"micromatch","version":"^4.0.2"},{"packageName":"pkg-dir","version":"^4.2.0"},{"packageName":"upath2","version":"^3.1.5"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.2.23","timestamp":"2020-08-09T08:46:11.344Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"micromatch","version":"^4.0.2"},{"packageName":"pkg-dir","version":"^4.2.0"},{"packageName":"upath2","version":"^3.1.6"}]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
