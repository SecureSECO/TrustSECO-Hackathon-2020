The available options are:\n\n* `unwrap` - set to `true` to delete the leading `/**`, any `*` that begins a line, and the trailing `*/` from the source text. Default: `false`.\n* `tags` - an array of tags to return. When specified, Doctrine returns only tags in this array. For example, if `tags` is `[\"param\"]`, then only `@param` tags will be returned. Default: `null`.\n* `recoverable` - set to `true` to keep parsing even when syntax errors occur. Default: `false`.\n* `sloppy` - set to `true` to allow optional parameters to be specified in brackets (`@param {string} [foo]`). Default: `false`.\n* `lineNumbers` - set to `true` to add `lineNumber` to each node, specifying the line on which the node is found in the source. Default: `false`.\n* `range` - set to `true` to add `range` to each node, specifying the start and end index of the node in the original comment. Default: `false`.\n\nHere's a simple example:\n\n```js\nvar ast = doctrine.parse(\n    [\n        \"/**\",\n        \" * This function comment is parsed by doctrine\",\n        \" * @param {{ok:String}} userName\",\n        \"*/\"\n    ].join('\\n'), { unwrap: true });\n```\n\nThis example returns the following AST:\n\n    {\n        \"description\": \"This function comment is parsed by doctrine\",\n        \"tags\": [\n            {\n                \"title\": \"param\",\n                \"description\": null,\n                \"type\": {\n                    \"type\": \"RecordType\",\n                    \"fields\": [\n                        {\n                            \"type\": \"FieldType\",\n                            \"key\": \"ok\",\n                            \"value\": {\n                                \"type\": \"NameExpression\",\n                                \"name\": \"String\"\n                            }\n                        }\n                    ]\n                },\n                \"name\": \"userName\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n\nSee the [demo page](http://eslint.org/doctrine/demo/) more detail.\n\n## Team\n\nThese folks keep the project moving and are resources for help:\n\n* Nicholas C.
