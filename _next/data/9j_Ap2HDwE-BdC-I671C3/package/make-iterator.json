Based on the `.makeIterator()` implementation in mout https://github.com/mout/mout.\n\nPlease consider following this project's author, [Jon Schlinkert](https://github.com/jonschlinkert), and consider starring the project to show your :heart: and support.\n\n## Install\n\nInstall with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):\n\n```sh\n$ npm install --save make-iterator\n```\n\nAlthough the code has materially changed, this was originally based on the\nmake iterator function in moutjs, and externalized to a module. Thanks to the\nmoutjs team for the inspiration.\n\nCopyright (c) 2012, 2013 moutjs team and contributors (http://moutjs.com)\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nvar iterator = require('make-iterator');\n```\n\n**Regex**\n\n```js\nvar arr = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'];\nvar fn = iterator(/[a-c]/);\nconsole.log(arr.filter(fn));\n//=> ['a', 'b', 'c'];\n```\n\n**Objects**\n\n```js\nvar fn =  iterator({ a: 1, b: { c: 2 } });\n\nconsole.log(fn({ a: 1, b: { c: 2, d: 3 } }));\n//=> true\nconsole.log(fn({ a: 1, b: { c: 3 } }));\n//=> false\n```\n\n## About\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Contributing</strong></summary>\n\nPull requests and stars are always welcome.
