The definition for `pit()` is stupid\nsimple.\n","homepage":"https://github.com/jeffmo/jasmine-pit","trustScore":14,"sourceRank":{"basic_info_present":1,"repository_present":1,"readme_present":1,"license_present":1,"versions_present":1,"follows_semver":1,"recent_release":0,"not_brand_new":1,"one_point_oh":1,"dependent_projects":2,"dependent_repositories":2,"stars":1,"contributors":1,"subscribers":0,"all_prereleases":0,"any_outdated_dependencies":0,"is_deprecated":0,"is_unmaintained":0,"is_removed":0,"trustScore":14},"versions":[{"versionNumber":"1.0.0","timestamp":"2013-12-11T23:47:38.639Z","trustScore":6,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.1","timestamp":"2013-12-11T23:55:41.636Z","trustScore":6,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.2","timestamp":"2013-12-23T14:41:55.608Z","trustScore":6,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.3","timestamp":"2014-07-16T06:32:07.418Z","trustScore":7,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.4","timestamp":"2014-07-16T20:54:33.513Z","trustScore":7,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.0","timestamp":"2014-11-03T21:52:20.910Z","trustScore":6,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.1","timestamp":"2015-02-28T19:44:21.456Z","trustScore":6,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.2","timestamp":"2015-03-01T00:51:09.287Z","trustScore":14,"dependencies":[]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
