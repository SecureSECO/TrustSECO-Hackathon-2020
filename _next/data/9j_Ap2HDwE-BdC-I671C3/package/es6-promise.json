The implementation is a subset of [rsvp.js](https://github.com/tildeio/rsvp.js) extracted by @jakearchibald, if you're wanting extra features and more debugging options, check out the [full library](https://github.com/tildeio/rsvp.js).\n\nFor API details and how to use promises, see the <a href=\"http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/es6/promises/\">JavaScript Promises HTML5Rocks article</a>.\n\n## Downloads\n\n* [es6-promise 27.86 KB (7.33 KB gzipped)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/es6-promise/dist/es6-promise.js)\n* [es6-promise-auto 27.78 KB (7.3 KB gzipped)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/es6-promise/dist/es6-promise.auto.js) - Automatically provides/replaces `Promise` if missing or broken.\n* [es6-promise-min 6.17 KB (2.4 KB gzipped)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/es6-promise/dist/es6-promise.min.js)\n* [es6-promise-auto-min 6.19 KB (2.4 KB gzipped)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/es6-promise/dist/es6-promise.auto.min.js) - Minified version of `es6-promise-auto` above.\n\n## CDN \n\nTo use via a CDN include this in your html:\n\n```html\n<!-- Automatically provides/replaces `Promise` if missing or broken. -->\n<script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/es6-promise@4/dist/es6-promise.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/es6-promise@4/dist/es6-promise.auto.js\"></script> \n\n<!-- Minified version of `es6-promise-auto` below. -->\n<script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/es6-promise@4/dist/es6-promise.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/es6-promise@4/dist/es6-promise.auto.min.js\"></script> \n\n```\n\n## Node.js\n\nTo install:\n\n```sh\nyarn add es6-promise\n```\n\nor\n\n```sh\nnpm install es6-promise\n```\n\nTo use:\n\n```js\nvar Promise = require('es6-promise').Promise;\n```\n\n\n## Usage in IE<9\n\n`catch` and `finally` are reserved keywords in IE<9, meaning\n`promise.catch(func)` or `promise.finally(func)` throw a syntax error. To work\naround this, you can use a string to access the property as shown in the\nfollowing example.\n\nHowever most minifiers will automatically fix this for you, making the\nresulting code safe for old browsers and production:\n\n```js\npromise['catch'](function(err) {\n  // ...\n});\n```\n\n```js\npromise['finally'](function() {\n  // ...\n});\n```\n\n## Auto-polyfill\n\nTo polyfill the global environment (either in Node or in the browser via CommonJS) use the following code snippet:\n\n```js\nrequire('es6-promise').polyfill();\n```\n\nAlternatively\n\n```js\nrequire('es6-promise/auto');\n```\n\nNotice that we don't assign the result of `polyfill()` to any variable. The `polyfill()` method will patch the global environment (in this case to the `Promise` name) when called.\n\n## Building & Testing\n\nYou will need to have PhantomJS installed globally in order to run the tests.\n\n`npm install -g phantomjs`\n\n* `npm run build` to build\n* `npm test` to run tests\n* `npm start` to run a build watcher, and webserver to test\n* `npm run test:server` for a testem test runner and watching builder\n","homepage":"https://github.com/stefanpenner/es6-promise","trustScore":28,"sourceRank":{"basic_info_present":1,"repository_present":1,"readme_present":1,"license_present":1,"versions_present":1,"follows_semver":1,"recent_release":0,"not_brand_new":1,"one_point_oh":1,"dependent_projects":8,"dependent_repositories":5,"stars":4,"contributors":1,"subscribers":2,"all_prereleases":0,"any_outdated_dependencies":0,"is_deprecated":0,"is_unmaintained":0,"is_removed":0,"trustScore":28},"versions":[{"versionNumber":"0.1.0","timestamp":"2013-12-16T09:58:06.703Z","trustScore":12,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.1","timestamp":"2013-12-19T13:38:51.838Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.2","timestamp":"2014-04-28T17:53:39.952Z","trustScore":13,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.0","timestamp":"2014-04-28T18:14:34.393Z","trustScore":15,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.0","timestamp":"2014-10-14T13:17:01.430Z","trustScore":13,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.1","timestamp":"2014-12-08T08:46:21.392Z","trustScore":14,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.1.0","timestamp":"2015-04-15T10:18:42.204Z","trustScore":13,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.1.1","timestamp":"2015-04-23T14:34:20.204Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.2.0","timestamp":"2015-06-05T08:09:27.688Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.3.0","timestamp":"2015-06-10T09:16:41.507Z","trustScore":12,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"3.0.0","timestamp":"2015-08-10T22:28:21.674Z","trustScore":12,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"3.0.1","timestamp":"2015-08-10T22:29:20.987Z","trustScore":13,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"3.0.2","timestamp":"2015-08-10T22:36:16.432Z","trustScore":13,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"3.1.2","timestamp":"2016-02-13T17:05:59.948Z","trustScore":13,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"3.2.1","timestamp":"2016-05-12T04:36:14.641Z","trustScore":13,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"3.3.0","timestamp":"2016-09-12T22:50:10.454Z","trustScore":13,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"3.3.1","timestamp":"2016-09-14T18:03:04.355Z","trustScore":14,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"4.0.0","timestamp":"2016-09-27T00:47:13.801Z","trustScore":13,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"4.0.1","timestamp":"2016-09-27T01:50:09.669Z","trustScore":13,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"4.0.2","timestamp":"2016-09-27T01:52:53.333Z","trustScore":13,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"4.0.3","timestamp":"2016-09-27T16:54:18.117Z","trustScore":12,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"4.0.4","timestamp":"2016-10-03T04:24:43.435Z","trustScore":14,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"4.0.5","timestamp":"2016-10-04T00:06:08.744Z","trustScore":12,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"4.1.0","timestamp":"2017-03-07T18:34:41.594Z","trustScore":12,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"4.1.1","timestamp":"2017-06-28T16:32:14.087Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"4.2.0","timestamp":"2017-12-21T18:39:34.115Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"4.2.1","timestamp":"2017-12-21T18:40:49.758Z","trustScore":12,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"4.2.2","timestamp":"2017-12-22T03:32:22.714Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"4.2.3","timestamp":"2018-01-23T19:13:54.749Z","trustScore":12,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"4.2.4","timestamp":"2018-01-23T20:32:16.734Z","trustScore":13,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"4.2.5","timestamp":"2018-09-10T22:10:11.910Z","trustScore":14,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"4.2.6","timestamp":"2019-02-16T16:19:16.880Z","trustScore":14,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"4.2.7","timestamp":"2019-06-06T17:58:31.364Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"4.2.8","timestamp":"2019-06-06T17:59:23.476Z","trustScore":28,"dependencies":[]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
