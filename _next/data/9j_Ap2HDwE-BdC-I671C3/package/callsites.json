This is the name of the function stored in the constructor field of `this`, if available, otherwise the object's `[[Class]]` internal property.\n- `getFunction`: returns the current function.\n- `getFunctionName`: returns the name of the current function, typically its `name` property. If a name property is not available an attempt will be made to try to infer a name from the function's context.\n- `getMethodName`: returns the name of the property of `this` or one of its prototypes that holds the current function.\n- `getFileName`: if this function was defined in a script returns the name of the script.\n- `getLineNumber`: if this function was defined in a script returns the current line number.\n- `getColumnNumber`: if this function was defined in a script returns the current column number\n- `getEvalOrigin`: if this function was created using a call to `eval` returns a string representing the location where `eval` was called.\n- `isToplevel`: is this a top-level invocation, that is, is this the global object?\n- `isEval`: does this call take place in code defined by a call to `eval`?\n- `isNative`: is this call in native V8 code?\n- `isConstructor`: is this a constructor call?\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT Â© [Sindre Sorhus](https://sindresorhus.com)\n","homepage":"https://github.com/sindresorhus/callsites#readme","trustScore":24,"sourceRank":{"basic_info_present":1,"repository_present":1,"readme_present":1,"license_present":1,"versions_present":1,"follows_semver":1,"recent_release":0,"not_brand_new":1,"one_point_oh":1,"dependent_projects":6,"dependent_repositories":6,"stars":2,"contributors":0,"subscribers":2,"all_prereleases":0,"any_outdated_dependencies":0,"is_deprecated":0,"is_unmaintained":0,"is_removed":0,"trustScore":24},"versions":[{"versionNumber":"0.1.0","timestamp":"2014-04-19T10:11:43.316Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.2.0","timestamp":"2014-04-19T10:12:18.747Z","trustScore":12,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.0","timestamp":"2014-08-17T18:47:35.372Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.1","timestamp":"2016-05-11T13:34:39.471Z","trustScore":12,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.0","timestamp":"2016-08-28T00:30:10.498Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"3.0.0","timestamp":"2018-11-19T17:36:49.033Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"3.1.0","timestamp":"2019-04-06T11:57:30.657Z","trustScore":24,"dependencies":[]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
