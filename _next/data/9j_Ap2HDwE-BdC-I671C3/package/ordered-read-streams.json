This is `objectMode = true` stream.\n\n## Example\n\n```js\nvar through = require('through2');\nvar Ordered = require('ordered-read-streams');\n\nvar s1 = through.obj(function (data, enc, next) {\n  var self = this;\n  setTimeout(function () {\n    self.push(data);\n    next();\n  }, 200)\n});\nvar s2 = through.obj(function (data, enc, next) {\n  var self = this;\n  setTimeout(function () {\n    self.push(data);\n    next();\n  }, 30)\n});\nvar s3 = through.obj(function (data, enc, next) {\n  var self = this;\n  setTimeout(function () {\n    self.push(data);\n    next();\n  }, 100)\n});\n\nvar streams = new Ordered([s1, s2, s3]);\nstreams.on('data', function (data) {\n  console.log(data);\n})\n\ns1.write('stream 1');\ns1.end();\n\ns2.write('stream 2');\ns2.end();\n\ns3.write('stream 3');\ns3.end();\n```\nOuput will be:\n\n```\nstream 1\nstream 2\nstream 3\n```\n\n## Licence\n\nMIT\n","homepage":"https://github.com/armed/ordered-read-streams#readme","trustScore":13,"sourceRank":{"basic_info_present":1,"repository_present":0,"readme_present":0,"license_present":1,"versions_present":1,"follows_semver":1,"recent_release":0,"not_brand_new":1,"one_point_oh":1,"dependent_projects":2,"dependent_repositories":5,"stars":0,"contributors":0,"subscribers":1,"all_prereleases":0,"any_outdated_dependencies":-1,"is_deprecated":0,"is_unmaintained":0,"is_removed":0,"trustScore":13},"versions":[{"versionNumber":"0.0.1","timestamp":"2014-01-15T06:50:22.498Z","trustScore":6,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.2","timestamp":"2014-01-15T08:37:31.561Z","trustScore":6,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.3","timestamp":"2014-01-16T12:32:57.127Z","trustScore":6,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.4","timestamp":"2014-01-17T05:03:16.244Z","trustScore":6,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.5","timestamp":"2014-01-18T07:16:21.362Z","trustScore":6,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.6","timestamp":"2014-01-18T08:06:01.450Z","trustScore":6,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.7","timestamp":"2014-01-18T08:32:14.360Z","trustScore":6,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.8","timestamp":"2014-07-01T08:20:59.498Z","trustScore":5,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.0","timestamp":"2014-09-30T10:02:03.929Z","trustScore":6,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.2.0","timestamp":"2015-03-02T08:34:33.897Z","trustScore":5,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"isstream","version":"^0.1.1"},{"packageName":"readable-stream","version":"^1.0.33"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.3.0","timestamp":"2015-07-04T12:40:31.826Z","trustScore":6,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"is-stream","version":"^1.0.1"},{"packageName":"readable-stream","version":"^2.0.1"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.0","timestamp":"2016-09-13T05:37:22.015Z","trustScore":5,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"is-stream","version":"^1.0.1"},{"packageName":"readable-stream","version":"^2.0.1"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.1","timestamp":"2017-05-09T16:32:51.945Z","trustScore":13,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"readable-stream","version":"^2.0.1"}]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
