Called by the main function if for some reason size was not available from `process.stdout` and `process.stderr`.\n\n```js\nconsole.log(size.env());\n```\n\n### .tty\n\nAttempts to get the size from `tty`. Called by the main function if for some reason size was not available from `process.stdout`, `process.stderr` or `process.env`.\n\n```js\nconsole.log(size.tty());\n```\n\n### .win\n\nGet the terminal size in Windows 10+.\n\n```js\nconsole.log(size.win());\n```\n\nNote that this method calls [execSync](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_execsync_command_options) to get the size, and must be called directly, as it **is not** called by the main function.\n\n### .tput\n\nGet the terminal size by calling the unix `$ tput` command.\n\n```js\nconsole.log(size.tput());\n```\n\nNote that this method calls [execSync](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_execsync_command_options) to get the size, and must be called directly, as it **is not** called by the main function.\n\n### utils\n\nIn some environments the main export may not be able to find a window size using the default methods. In this case, `size` will be `undefined` and the functions will not be exported.\n\nBecause of this, the functions have been exported in a separate file and can be required directly.\n\n```js\nvar utils = require('window-size/utils');\nconsole.log(utils.win());\n```\n\n## About\n\n### Related projects\n\n* [base-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/base-cli): Plugin for base-methods that maps built-in methods to CLI args (also supports methods from a… [more](https://github.com/node-base/base-cli) | [homepage](https://github.com/node-base/base-cli \"Plugin for base-methods that maps built-in methods to CLI args (also supports methods from a few plugins, like 'base-store', 'base-options' and 'base-data'.\")\n* [lint-deps](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lint-deps): CLI tool that tells you when dependencies are missing from package.json and offers you a… [more](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/lint-deps) | [homepage](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/lint-deps \"CLI tool that tells you when dependencies are missing from package.json and offers you a choice to install them.
