If empty, the output will have only one line.\n\t\nExample :\n\n```javascript\nvar fs = require('fs'),\n    cssmin = require('ycssmin').cssmin,\n    css = fs.readFileSync(\"/Any/Random/CSS/File.css\", encoding='utf8'),\n    min = cssmin(css);\n\nconsole.log(min);\n```\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n    Copyright 2012 Yahoo!
