You can just plug `cli-usage` in without thinking\nabout paramters, or you can handle that your self using the\n`.get` API end-point.\n\n## Install\n\n```\nnpm install cli-usage\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nMost basic usage, just plug in:\n\n```javascript\nvar usage = require('cli-usage');\nusage();\n//=> If help-flag is passed, print usage\n//=> and exit with code 0.\n```\n\nThis will listen for `-h`, `-help` or `--help` passed\ninto your CLI and try to locate a `usage.md` file from\nthe directory of the file. If `help` is passed and the\n`usage.md` file found, the usage will be printed and\nthe application will exit with code `0`.\n\nYou can also pass in a filename or a string.\n\n```javascript\nvar usage = require('cli-usage');\nusage('./some/path/to/usage.md');\n```\n\nor\n\n```javascript\nvar usage = require('cli-usage');\nusage('# Simple usage');\n```\n\n### Get compiled usage\nInstead of `cli-usage` doing all the work, you can\nalso just retrieve the compiled usage text and handle\nit your self.\n\n#### Example\n```javascript\nvar usage = require('cli-usage');\n\nconsole.log(usage.get('# some custom markdown from string'));\n\nconsole.log(usage.get('./usage.md'));\n```\n","homepage":"https://github.com/mikaelbr/cli-usage","trustScore":15,"sourceRank":{"basic_info_present":1,"repository_present":1,"readme_present":1,"license_present":1,"versions_present":1,"follows_semver":1,"recent_release":0,"not_brand_new":1,"one_point_oh":0,"dependent_projects":2,"dependent_repositories":4,"stars":1,"contributors":1,"subscribers":1,"all_prereleases":0,"any_outdated_dependencies":-1,"is_deprecated":0,"is_unmaintained":0,"is_removed":0,"trustScore":15},"versions":[{"versionNumber":"0.1.1","timestamp":"2014-07-28T22:31:56.514Z","trustScore":7,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"marked","version":"^0.3.2"},{"packageName":"minimist","version":"^0.2.0"},{"packageName":"marked-terminal","version":"^0.1.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.2","timestamp":"2015-08-26T17:05:50.752Z","trustScore":7,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"marked","version":"^0.3.2"},{"packageName":"marked-terminal","version":"^1.6.1"},{"packageName":"minimist","version":"^0.2.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.3","timestamp":"2016-09-02T20:04:19.876Z","trustScore":7,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"marked","version":"^0.3.6"},{"packageName":"marked-terminal","version":"^1.6.2"},{"packageName":"mocha","version":"^3.0.2"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.4","timestamp":"2016-09-08T08:51:28.114Z","trustScore":6,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"marked","version":"^0.3.6"},{"packageName":"marked-terminal","version":"^1.6.2"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.7","timestamp":"2018-01-11T07:18:19.831Z","trustScore":5,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"marked","version":"^0.3.12"},{"packageName":"marked-terminal","version":"^2.0.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.8","timestamp":"2018-09-08T08:16:07.044Z","trustScore":7,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"marked","version":"^0.5.0"},{"packageName":"marked-terminal","version":"^3.0.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.9","timestamp":"2019-04-15T11:06:22.324Z","trustScore":6,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"marked","version":"^0.6.2"},{"packageName":"marked-terminal","version":"^3.2.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.10","timestamp":"2019-09-23T06:19:38.395Z","trustScore":15,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"marked","version":"^0.7.0"},{"packageName":"marked-terminal","version":"^3.3.0"}]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
