If this argument is an array, it will\n  be wrapped in `{streams: ...}`.\n\n_options_\n\n* _streams_ - an array of streams to add at instantiation time.\n* _bubbleErrors_ - a boolean value specifying whether to bubble errors up from\n  the wrapped streams.\n\nExample\n-------\n\nAlso see [example.js](https://github.com/deoxxa/combine-stream/blob/master/example.js).\n\n```javascript\nvar stream = require(\"stream\");\n\nvar CombineStream = require(\"combine-stream\");\n\nvar delayed = function delayed(n) {\n  var s = new stream.Transform({objectMode: true});\n\n  s._transform = function _transform(input, encoding, done) {\n    var self = this;\n\n    return setTimeout(function() {\n      self.push(input + \" \" + n);\n\n      return done();\n    }, n);\n  };\n\n  s._flush = function _flush(done) {\n    console.log(\"ending!\", n);\n\n    setTimeout(done, n);\n  };\n\n  return s;\n};\n\nvar combine = new CombineStream();\n\nvar streamA = delayed(100),\n    streamB = delayed(500);\n\nvar combine = new CombineStream([streamA, streamB]);\n\ncombine.on(\"data\", console.log);\ncombine.on(\"error\", console.log);\n\ncombine.write(\"hello 1\");\ncombine.write(\"hello 2\");\ncombine.write(\"hello 3\");\n\ncombine.end(function() {\n  console.log(\"everything finished\");\n});\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\nhello 1 100\nhello 1 500\nhello 2 100\nhello 2 500\nhello 3 100\nhello 3 500\nending! 100\nending! 500\neverything finished\n```\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n3-clause BSD.
