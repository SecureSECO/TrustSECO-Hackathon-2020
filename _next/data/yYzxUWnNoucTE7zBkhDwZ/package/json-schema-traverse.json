Schema references ($ref) are not resolved, they are passed as is.  Alternatively, you can pass a `{pre, post}` object as `cb`, and then `pre` will be called before traversing child elements, and `post` will be called after all child elements have been traversed.\n\nCallback is passed these parameters:\n\n- _schema_: the current schema object\n- _JSON pointer_: from the root schema to the current schema object\n- _root schema_: the schema passed to `traverse` object\n- _parent JSON pointer_: from the root schema to the parent schema object (see below)\n- _parent keyword_: the keyword inside which this schema appears (e.g. `properties`, `anyOf`, etc.)\n- _parent schema_: not necessarily parent object/array; in the example above the parent schema for `{type: 'string'}` is the root schema\n- _index/property_: index or property name in the array/object containing multiple schemas; in the example above for `{type: 'string'}` the property name is `'foo'`\n\n\n## Traverse objects in all unknown keywords\n\n```javascript\nconst traverse = require('json-schema-traverse');\nconst schema = {\n  mySchema: {\n    minimum: 1,\n    maximum: 2\n  }\n};\n\ntraverse(schema, {allKeys: true, cb});\n// cb is called 2 times with:\n// 1. root schema\n// 2. mySchema\n```\n\nWithout option `allKeys: true` callback will be called only with root schema.\n\n\n## Enterprise support\n\njson-schema-traverse package is a part of [Tidelift enterprise subscription](https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/npm-json-schema-traverse?utm_source=npm-json-schema-traverse&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=enterprise&utm_term=repo) - it provides a centralised commercial support to open-source software users, in addition to the support provided by software maintainers.\n\n\n## Security contact\n\nTo report a security vulnerability, please use the\n[Tidelift security contact](https://tidelift.com/security).\nTidelift will coordinate the fix and disclosure.
