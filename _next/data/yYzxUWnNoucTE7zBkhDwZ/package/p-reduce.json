The fulfilled value is the result of the reduction.\n\n#### input\n\nType: `Iterable<Promise|any>`\n\nIterated over serially in the `reducer` function.\n\n#### reducer(previousValue, currentValue, index)\n\nType: `Function`\n\nExpected to return a value. If a `Promise` is returned, it's awaited before continuing with the next iteration.\n\n#### initialValue\n\nType: `unknown`\n\nValue to use as `previousValue` in the first `reducer` invocation.\n\n\n## Related\n\n- [p-each-series](https://github.com/sindresorhus/p-each-series) - Iterate over promises serially\n- [p-map-series](https://github.com/sindresorhus/p-map-series) - Map over promises serially\n- [p-map](https://github.com/sindresorhus/p-map) - Map over promises concurrently\n- [More…](https://github.com/sindresorhus/promise-fun)\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT © [Sindre Sorhus](https://sindresorhus.com)\n","homepage":"https://github.com/sindresorhus/p-reduce#readme","trustScore":20,"sourceRank":{"basic_info_present":1,"repository_present":1,"readme_present":1,"license_present":1,"versions_present":1,"follows_semver":1,"recent_release":0,"not_brand_new":1,"one_point_oh":1,"dependent_projects":4,"dependent_repositories":5,"stars":2,"contributors":0,"subscribers":1,"all_prereleases":0,"any_outdated_dependencies":0,"is_deprecated":0,"is_unmaintained":0,"is_removed":0,"trustScore":20},"versions":[{"versionNumber":"1.0.0","timestamp":"2016-10-21T04:24:28.119Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.0","timestamp":"2019-03-12T05:12:38.774Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.1.0","timestamp":"2019-04-04T04:57:45.948Z","trustScore":20,"dependencies":[]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
