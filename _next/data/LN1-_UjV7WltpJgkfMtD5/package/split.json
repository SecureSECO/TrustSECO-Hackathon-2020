To prevent this set `options.trailing` to `false`.\n\n``` js\n  split(JSON.parse, null, { trailing: false })\n```\n\n## keep matched splitter\n\nAs with `String#split`, if you split by a regular expression with a matching group,\nthe matches will be retained in the collection.\n\n```\nstdin\n.pipe(split(/(\\r?\\n)/))\n... //lines + separators.\n```\n\n\n# NDJ - Newline Delimited Json\n\n`split` accepts a function which transforms each line.\n\n``` js\nfs.createReadStream(file)\n  .pipe(split(JSON.parse))\n  .on('data', function (obj) {\n    //each chunk now is a a js object\n  })\n  .on('error', function (err) {\n    //syntax errors will land here\n    //note, this ends the stream.\n  })\n```\n\n# License\n\nMIT\n","homepage":"http://github.com/dominictarr/split","trustScore":25,"sourceRank":{"basic_info_present":1,"repository_present":1,"readme_present":1,"license_present":1,"versions_present":1,"follows_semver":1,"recent_release":0,"not_brand_new":1,"one_point_oh":1,"dependent_projects":6,"dependent_repositories":5,"stars":3,"contributors":1,"subscribers":2,"all_prereleases":0,"any_outdated_dependencies":0,"is_deprecated":0,"is_unmaintained":0,"is_removed":0,"trustScore":25},"versions":[{"versionNumber":"0.0.0","timestamp":"2012-08-30T14:21:57.957Z","trustScore":24,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"through","version":"0.0.4"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.0","timestamp":"2012-08-30T14:37:53.053Z","trustScore":25,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"through","version":"0.0.4"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.1","timestamp":"2013-01-06T10:24:50.760Z","trustScore":26,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"through","version":"1"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.2","timestamp":"2013-01-23T00:07:27.593Z","trustScore":25,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"through","version":"1"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.2.0","timestamp":"2013-02-05T07:14:33.746Z","trustScore":25,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"through","version":"2"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.2.1","timestamp":"2013-02-14T23:19:03.153Z","trustScore":24,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"through","version":"2"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.2.3","timestamp":"2013-04-11T08:58:24.117Z","trustScore":27,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"through","version":"2"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.2.4","timestamp":"2013-04-12T15:27:07.809Z","trustScore":23,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"through","version":"2"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.2.5","timestamp":"2013-04-25T16:18:29.114Z","trustScore":24,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"through","version":"2"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.2.6","timestamp":"2013-07-11T07:12:00.385Z","trustScore":23,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"through","version":"2"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.2.7","timestamp":"2013-08-06T16:03:52.085Z","trustScore":29,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"through","version":"2"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.2.8","timestamp":"2013-08-06T16:05:21.343Z","trustScore":28,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"through","version":"2"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.2.9","timestamp":"2013-08-07T08:46:01.975Z","trustScore":23,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"through","version":"2"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.2.10","timestamp":"2013-08-07T08:48:33.572Z","trustScore":24,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"through","version":"2"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.3.0","timestamp":"2014-01-29T18:11:50.069Z","trustScore":23,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"through","version":"2"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.3.1","timestamp":"2014-11-03T16:41:06.661Z","trustScore":28,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"through","version":"2"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.3.2","timestamp":"2014-12-02T14:06:56.546Z","trustScore":26,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"through","version":"2"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.3.3","timestamp":"2015-02-02T10:08:33.385Z","trustScore":25,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"through","version":"2"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.0","timestamp":"2015-05-24T17:07:19.889Z","trustScore":22,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"through","version":"2"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.1","timestamp":"2017-08-03T08:03:58.517Z","trustScore":27,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"through","version":"2"}]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
