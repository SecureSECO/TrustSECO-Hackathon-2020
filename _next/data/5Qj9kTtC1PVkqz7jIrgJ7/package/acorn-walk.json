For questions\nand discussion, please use the\n[Tern discussion forum](https://discuss.ternjs.net).\n\n## Installation\n\nThe easiest way to install acorn is from [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/):\n\n```sh\nnpm install acorn-walk\n```\n\nAlternately, you can download the source and build acorn yourself:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/acornjs/acorn.git\ncd acorn\nnpm install\n```\n\n## Interface\n\nAn algorithm for recursing through a syntax tree is stored as an\nobject, with a property for each tree node type holding a function\nthat will recurse through such a node. There are several ways to run\nsuch a walker.\n\n**simple**`(node, visitors, base, state)` does a 'simple' walk over a\ntree. `node` should be the AST node to walk, and `visitors` an object\nwith properties whose names correspond to node types in the [ESTree\nspec](https://github.com/estree/estree). The properties should contain\nfunctions that will be called with the node object and, if applicable\nthe state at that point. The last two arguments are optional. `base`\nis a walker algorithm, and `state` is a start state. The default\nwalker will simply visit all statements and expressions and not\nproduce a meaningful state. (An example of a use of state is to track\nscope at each point in the tree.)\n\n```js\nconst acorn = require(\"acorn\")\nconst walk = require(\"acorn-walk\")\n\nwalk.simple(acorn.parse(\"let x = 10\"), {\n  Literal(node) {\n    console.log(`Found a literal: ${node.value}`)\n  }\n})\n```\n\n**ancestor**`(node, visitors, base, state)` does a 'simple' walk over\na tree, building up an array of ancestor nodes (including the current node)\nand passing the array to the callbacks as a third parameter.\n\n```js\nconst acorn = require(\"acorn\")\nconst walk = require(\"acorn-walk\")\n\nwalk.ancestor(acorn.parse(\"foo('hi')\"), {\n  Literal(_, ancestors) {\n    console.log(\"This literal's ancestors are:\", ancestors.map(n => n.type))\n  }\n})\n```\n\n**recursive**`(node, state, functions, base)` does a 'recursive'\nwalk, where the walker functions are responsible for continuing the\nwalk on the child nodes of their target node. `state` is the start\nstate, and `functions` should contain an object that maps node types\nto walker functions. Such functions are called with `(node, state, c)`\narguments, and can cause the walk to continue on a sub-node by calling\nthe `c` argument on it with `(node, state)` arguments. The optional\n`base` argument provides the fallback walker functions for node types\nthat aren't handled in the `functions` object. If not given, the\ndefault walkers will be used.\n\n**make**`(functions, base)` builds a new walker object by using the\nwalker functions in `functions` and filling in the missing ones by\ntaking defaults from `base`.\n\n**full**`(node, callback, base, state)` does a 'full' walk over a\ntree, calling the callback with the arguments (node, state, type) for\neach node\n\n**fullAncestor**`(node, callback, base, state)` does a 'full' walk\nover a tree, building up an array of ancestor nodes (including the\ncurrent node) and passing the array to the callbacks as a third\nparameter.\n\n```js\nconst acorn = require(\"acorn\")\nconst walk = require(\"acorn-walk\")\n\nwalk.full(acorn.parse(\"1 + 1\"), node => {\n  console.log(`There's a ${node.type} node at ${node.ch}`)\n})\n```\n\n**findNodeAt**`(node, start, end, test, base, state)` tries to locate\na node in a tree at the given start and/or end offsets, which\nsatisfies the predicate `test`. `start` and `end` can be either `null`\n(as wildcard) or a number. `test` may be a string (indicating a node\ntype) or a function that takes `(nodeType, node)` arguments and\nreturns a boolean indicating whether this node is interesting. `base`\nand `state` are optional, and can be used to specify a custom walker.\nNodes are tested from inner to outer, so if two nodes match the\nboundaries, the inner one will be preferred.\n\n**findNodeAround**`(node, pos, test, base, state)` is a lot like\n`findNodeAt`, but will match any node that exists 'around' (spanning)\nthe given position.\n\n**findNodeAfter**`(node, pos, test, base, state)` is similar to\n`findNodeAround`, but will match all nodes *after* the given position\n(testing outer nodes before inner nodes).\n","homepage":"https://github.com/acornjs/acorn","trustScore":27,"sourceRank":{"basic_info_present":1,"repository_present":1,"readme_present":1,"license_present":1,"versions_present":1,"follows_semver":1,"recent_release":1,"not_brand_new":1,"one_point_oh":1,"dependent_projects":6,"dependent_repositories":5,"stars":4,"contributors":1,"subscribers":2,"all_prereleases":0,"any_outdated_dependencies":0,"is_deprecated":0,"is_unmaintained":0,"is_removed":0,"trustScore":27},"versions":[{"versionNumber":"6.0.0","timestamp":"2018-09-14T07:21:12.347Z","trustScore":12,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"6.0.1","timestamp":"2018-09-14T07:23:40.533Z","trustScore":12,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"6.1.0","timestamp":"2018-09-28T06:28:40.772Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"6.1.1","timestamp":"2018-11-13T08:53:49.083Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"6.2.0","timestamp":"2019-07-04T06:34:56.385Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"7.0.0","timestamp":"2019-08-13T07:59:25.173Z","trustScore":12,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"7.1.0","timestamp":"2020-02-11T08:16:59.335Z","trustScore":16,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"7.1.1","timestamp":"2020-02-13T16:51:56.990Z","trustScore":18,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"7.2.0","timestamp":"2020-06-17T06:25:38.522Z","trustScore":22,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"8.0.0","timestamp":"2020-08-12T13:05:18.596Z","trustScore":27,"dependencies":[]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
