It's best if you just use one of the above libraries.\n2. If you're not, but sure you never `next`, `error` or `complete` on your observer after `error` or `complete` was called.\n3. Likewise, make sure you don't `next`, `error` or `complete` after `unsubscribe` is called on the returned object.\n\n```ts\nimport Symbol_observable from 'symbol-observable';\n\nsomeObject[Symbol_observable] = () => {\n  return {\n    subscribe(observer) {\n      const handler = e => observer.next(e);\n      someObject.addEventListener('data', handler);\n      return {\n        unsubscribe() {\n          someObject.removeEventListener('data', handler);\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    [Symbol_observable]() { return this }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOften, it's not very hard, but it can get tricky in some cases.\n\n## Related\n\n- [is-observable](https://github.com/sindresorhus/is-observable) - Check if a value is an Observable\n- [observable-to-promise](https://github.com/sindresorhus/observable-to-promise) - Convert an Observable to a Promise\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT Â© [Sindre Sorhus](https://sindresorhus.com) and [Ben Lesh](https://github.com/benlesh)\n","homepage":"https://github.com/blesh/symbol-observable#readme","trustScore":25,"sourceRank":{"basic_info_present":1,"repository_present":1,"readme_present":1,"license_present":1,"versions_present":1,"follows_semver":1,"recent_release":1,"not_brand_new":1,"one_point_oh":1,"dependent_projects":6,"dependent_repositories":5,"stars":2,"contributors":1,"subscribers":2,"all_prereleases":0,"any_outdated_dependencies":0,"is_deprecated":0,"is_unmaintained":0,"is_removed":0,"trustScore":25},"versions":[{"versionNumber":"0.1.0","timestamp":"2015-11-19T13:39:31.781Z","trustScore":12,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.2.0","timestamp":"2016-04-19T00:34:58.702Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.2.1","timestamp":"2016-04-19T00:46:42.106Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.2.2","timestamp":"2016-04-19T18:14:44.966Z","trustScore":12,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.2.3","timestamp":"2016-04-24T06:04:48.111Z","trustScore":12,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.2.4","timestamp":"2016-04-25T19:38:37.640Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.0","timestamp":"2016-06-13T22:18:20.607Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.1","timestamp":"2016-06-15T06:56:05.347Z","trustScore":12,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.2","timestamp":"2016-08-09T16:50:31.798Z","trustScore":12,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.3","timestamp":"2016-10-11T01:04:12.515Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.4","timestamp":"2016-10-13T20:59:21.924Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.1.0","timestamp":"2017-11-28T18:43:49.182Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.2.0","timestamp":"2018-01-26T17:41:50.380Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.0","timestamp":"2020-09-01T14:32:15.812Z","trustScore":23,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.1","timestamp":"2020-09-04T02:29:03.592Z","trustScore":25,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.2","timestamp":"2020-09-29T14:32:23.877Z","trustScore":25,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.3","timestamp":"2020-09-30T19:24:03.398Z","trustScore":25,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"3.0.0","timestamp":"2020-11-02T17:55:25.186Z","trustScore":25,"dependencies":[]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
