It supports XML namespaces, provides built-in converters for multiple formats, collection functions, and more. Please see [upgrading from xmlbuilder](https://oozcitak.github.io/xmlbuilder2/upgrading-from-xmlbuilder.html) in the wiki.\r\n\r\nNew development will be focused towards `xmlbuilder2`; `xmlbuilder` will only receive critical bug fixes.\r\n\r\n### Installation:\r\n\r\n``` sh\r\nnpm install xmlbuilder\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Usage:\r\n\r\n``` js\r\nvar builder = require('xmlbuilder');\r\n\r\nvar xml = builder.create('root')\r\n  .ele('xmlbuilder')\r\n    .ele('repo', {'type': 'git'}, 'git://github.com/oozcitak/xmlbuilder-js.git')\r\n  .end({ pretty: true});\r\n\r\nconsole.log(xml);\r\n```\r\n\r\nwill result in:\r\n\r\n``` xml\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\r\n<root>\r\n  <xmlbuilder>\r\n    <repo type=\"git\">git://github.com/oozcitak/xmlbuilder-js.git</repo>\r\n  </xmlbuilder>\r\n</root>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is also possible to convert objects into nodes:\r\n\r\n``` js\r\nvar builder = require('xmlbuilder');\r\n\r\nvar obj = {\r\n  root: {\r\n    xmlbuilder: {\r\n      repo: {\r\n        '@type': 'git', // attributes start with @\r\n        '#text': 'git://github.com/oozcitak/xmlbuilder-js.git' // text node\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n\r\nvar xml = builder.create(obj).end({ pretty: true});\r\nconsole.log(xml);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you need to do some processing:\r\n\r\n``` js\r\nvar builder = require('xmlbuilder');\r\n\r\nvar root = builder.create('squares');\r\nroot.com('f(x) = x^2');\r\nfor(var i = 1; i <= 5; i++)\r\n{\r\n  var item = root.ele('data');\r\n  item.att('x', i);\r\n  item.att('y', i * i);\r\n}\r\n\r\nvar xml = root.end({ pretty: true});\r\nconsole.log(xml);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will result in:\r\n\r\n``` xml\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\r\n<squares>\r\n  <!-- f(x) = x^2 -->\r\n  <data x=\"1\" y=\"1\"/>\r\n  <data x=\"2\" y=\"4\"/>\r\n  <data x=\"3\" y=\"9\"/>\r\n  <data x=\"4\" y=\"16\"/>\r\n  <data x=\"5\" y=\"25\"/>\r\n</squares>\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee the [wiki](https://github.com/oozcitak/xmlbuilder-js/wiki) for details and [examples](https://github.com/oozcitak/xmlbuilder-js/wiki/Examples) for more
