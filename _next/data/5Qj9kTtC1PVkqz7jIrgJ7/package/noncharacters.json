Perfect to use for placeholders or temporary replacements during string transformations.\n\nSee the wikipedia [article on non-characters][wiki]. Also, I used [regenerate](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/regenerate) from [mathiasbynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens) to generate the range of characters. \n\n## Install with [npm](npmjs.org)\n\n```bash\nnpm i noncharacters --save\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nvar noncharacters = require('noncharacters');\n//=> ['\\uFFFF', '\\uFFFE', ...]\n```\n\n**Example**\n\nLet's say you need to transform a string but you need to temporarily replace some characters that might cause issues. \n\nCreate your own placeholders:\n\n```js\n// arbitrary characters we want to replace, \n// mapped to placeholder non-characters\nvar placeholders = {\n  '{': noncharacters[0],\n  '}': noncharacters[1]\n};\n\n// the string with characters to replace\nvar str = 'This is a template: {name}';\n\n// actually replace the characters\nObject.keys(placeholders).forEach(function(ch) {\n  str = str.replace(ch, placeholders[ch]);\n});\n//=> This is a template: \\uFFFFname\\uFFFE\n```\nNow you can do whatever you want to `str`. Then, to change back:\n\n```js\nObject.keys(placeholders).forEach(function(ch) {\n  str = str.replace(placeholders[ch], ch);\n});\n//=> This is a template: {name}\n```\n\n\n## Run tests\n\nInstall dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm i -d && npm test\n```\n\n## Contributing\nPull requests and stars are always welcome.
