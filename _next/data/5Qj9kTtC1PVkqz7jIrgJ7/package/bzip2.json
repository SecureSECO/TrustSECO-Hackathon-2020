This bit reader function is what all the other methods, `header`, `decompress`, and `simple` use. \n\n`header(bitstream)` quite obviously reads in the bzip2 file header. It returns a single number between 1 and 9 describing the block size, which is one of the arguments of `decompress`\n\n`decompress(bitstream, size[, len])` does the main decompression of a single block. It'll return -1 if it detects that it's the final block, otherwise it returns a string with the decompressed data. If you want to cap the output to a certain number of bytes, set the `len` argument.\n\n`simple(bitstream)` is what you probably want to use, because it combines `header` and loops over `decompress` so that the entire file is decompressed and returned as a string.\n\n`array(typed_array)` is the function that generates that mythical bitstream function from a standard `Uint8Array` which you can make from an array buffer with `new Uint8Array(arraybuffer)`.\n","homepage":"https://github.com/jvrousseau/bzip2.js","trustScore":6,"sourceRank":{"basic_info_present":1,"repository_present":1,"readme_present":1,"license_present":0,"versions_present":1,"follows_semver":1,"recent_release":0,"not_brand_new":1,"one_point_oh":0,"dependent_projects":0,"dependent_repositories":0,"stars":0,"contributors":0,"subscribers":0,"all_prereleases":0,"any_outdated_dependencies":0,"is_deprecated":0,"is_unmaintained":0,"is_removed":0,"trustScore":6},"versions":[{"versionNumber":"0.1.0","timestamp":"2014-02-13T05:53:27.369Z","trustScore":2,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.1","timestamp":"2014-12-03T16:43:11.852Z","trustScore":6,"dependencies":[]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
