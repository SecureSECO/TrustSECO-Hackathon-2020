Similar to Perl's -B.","repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/gjtorikian/isBinaryFile.git"},"readme":"# isBinaryFile\n\nDetects if a file is binary in Node.js using ✨promises✨. Similar to [Perl's `-B` switch](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/899206/how-does-perl-know-a-file-is-binary), in that:\n- it reads the first few thousand bytes of a file\n- checks for a `null` byte; if it's found, it's binary\n- flags non-ASCII characters. After a certain number of \"weird\" characters, the file is flagged as binary\n\nMuch of the logic is pretty much ported from [ag](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher).\n\nNote: if the file doesn't exist or is a directory, an error is thrown.\n\n## Installation\n\n```\nnpm install isbinaryfile\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nReturns `Promise<boolean>` (or just `boolean` for `*Sync`). `true` if the file is binary, `false` otherwise.\n\n### isBinaryFile(filepath)\n\n* `filepath` -  a `string` indicating the path to the file.\n\n### isBinaryFile(bytes[, size])\n\n* `bytes` - a `Buffer` of the file's contents.\n* `size` - an optional `number` indicating the file size.\n\n### isBinaryFileSync(filepath)\n\n* `filepath` - a `string` indicating the path to the file.\n\n\n### isBinaryFileSync(bytes[, size])\n\n* `bytes` - a `Buffer` of the file's contents.\n* `size` - an optional `number` indicating the file size.\n\n### Examples\n\nHere's an arbitrary usage:\n\n```javascript\nconst isBinaryFile = require(\"isbinaryfile\").isBinaryFile;\nconst fs = require(\"fs\");\n\nconst filename = \"fixtures/pdf.pdf\";\nconst data = fs.readFileSync(filename);\nconst stat = fs.lstatSync(filename);\n\nisBinaryFile(data, stat.size).then((result) => {\n  if (result) {\n    console.log(\"It is binary!\")\n  }\n  else {\n    console.log(\"No it is not.\")\n  }\n});\n\nconst isBinaryFileSync = require(\"isbinaryfile\").isBinaryFileSync;\nconst bytes = fs.readFileSync(filename);\nconst size = fs.lstatSync(filename).size;\nconsole.log(isBinaryFileSync(bytes, size)); // true or false\n```\n\n## Testing\n\nRun `npm install`, then run `npm test`.\n","homepage":"https://github.com/gjtorikian/isBinaryFile#readme","trustScore":23,"sourceRank":{"basic_info_present":1,"repository_present":1,"readme_present":1,"license_present":1,"versions_present":1,"follows_semver":1,"recent_release":0,"not_brand_new":1,"one_point_oh":1,"dependent_projects":6,"dependent_repositories":5,"stars":2,"contributors":1,"subscribers":1,"all_prereleases":0,"any_outdated_dependencies":0,"is_deprecated":0,"is_unmaintained":0,"is_removed":0,"trustScore":23},"versions":[{"versionNumber":"0.1.0","timestamp":"2012-10-09T05:40:12.609Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.1","timestamp":"2012-10-14T18:17:33.729Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.2","timestamp":"2012-10-15T20:29:48.898Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.3","timestamp":"2012-10-26T05:12:53.570Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.4","timestamp":"2012-11-08T17:32:51.454Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.5","timestamp":"2012-12-24T10:10:38.979Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.6","timestamp":"2013-03-13T07:15:56.885Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.7","timestamp":"2013-03-19T02:16:31.881Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.8","timestamp":"2013-03-19T17:47:00.807Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.9","timestamp":"2013-05-24T21:32:05.109Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.0","timestamp":"2013-12-02T22:46:32.609Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.1","timestamp":"2013-12-20T18:21:01.787Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.0","timestamp":"2013-12-24T16:55:20.032Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.1","timestamp":"2014-01-28T09:22:41.567Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.2","timestamp":"2014-10-23T08:01:20.396Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.3","timestamp":"2014-11-19T18:59:40.860Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.4","timestamp":"2015-05-04T16:33:43.046Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"3.0.0","timestamp":"2015-08-05T00:09:55.183Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"3.0.1","timestamp":"2016-08-08T23:06:34.025Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"3.0.2","timestamp":"2017-01-02T19:57:42.794Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"3.0.3","timestamp":"2018-08-02T19:30:37.009Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"buffer-alloc","version":"^1.2.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"4.0.0-rc1","timestamp":"2019-01-08T02:39:42.134Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"4.0.0","timestamp":"2019-01-08T02:55:09.341Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"4.0.1","timestamp":"2019-06-05T21:34:55.055Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"4.0.2","timestamp":"2019-07-11T12:22:21.711Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"4.0.3","timestamp":"2019-12-29T11:40:06.820Z","trustScore":13,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"4.0.4","timestamp":"2020-01-12T11:32:19.534Z","trustScore":14,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"4.0.5","timestamp":"2020-03-17T19:29:13.286Z","trustScore":14,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"4.0.6","timestamp":"2020-04-03T14:30:07.687Z","trustScore":23,"dependencies":[]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
