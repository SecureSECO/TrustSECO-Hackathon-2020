Because I don't want to include large binary files in this repository, the files are created by running an npm script.\n\n    npm run prepare-long-test\n\nYou can now\n\n    npm run long-test\n\nAnd to run a test in chrome that downloads and decompresses a large binary file\n\n    npm run download-test\n\nOpen the browser's console to see the output.\n\n","homepage":"https://github.com/regular/unbzip2-stream#readme","trustScore":19,"sourceRank":{"basic_info_present":1,"repository_present":1,"readme_present":1,"license_present":1,"versions_present":1,"follows_semver":1,"recent_release":1,"not_brand_new":1,"one_point_oh":1,"dependent_projects":4,"dependent_repositories":4,"stars":1,"contributors":1,"subscribers":1,"all_prereleases":0,"any_outdated_dependencies":-1,"is_deprecated":0,"is_unmaintained":0,"is_removed":0,"trustScore":19},"versions":[{"versionNumber":"1.0.0","timestamp":"2015-01-28T12:22:12.102Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"through","version":"^2.3.6"},{"packageName":"buffer","version":"^3.0.1"},{"packageName":"bzip2","version":"^0.1.1"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.1","timestamp":"2015-01-28T12:23:41.026Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"through","version":"^2.3.6"},{"packageName":"buffer","version":"^3.0.1"},{"packageName":"bzip2","version":"^0.1.1"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.2","timestamp":"2015-01-28T12:31:47.417Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"through","version":"^2.3.6"},{"packageName":"buffer","version":"^3.0.1"},{"packageName":"bzip2","version":"^0.1.1"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.3","timestamp":"2015-01-28T12:34:29.895Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"through","version":"^2.3.6"},{"packageName":"buffer","version":"^3.0.1"},{"packageName":"bzip2","version":"^0.1.1"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.4","timestamp":"2015-01-29T22:19:54.500Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"through","version":"^2.3.6"},{"packageName":"buffer","version":"^3.0.1"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.7","timestamp":"2015-01-29T22:58:12.708Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"through","version":"^2.3.6"},{"packageName":"buffer","version":"^3.0.1"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.8","timestamp":"2015-01-29T23:10:07.741Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"through","version":"^2.3.6"},{"packageName":"buffer","version":"^3.0.1"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.9","timestamp":"2016-03-21T20:27:49.828Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"through","version":"^2.3.6"},{"packageName":"buffer","version":"^3.0.1"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.10","timestamp":"2016-09-12T13:16:28.494Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"through","version":"^2.3.6"},{"packageName":"buffer","version":"^3.0.1"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.11","timestamp":"2017-03-21T13:47:09.992Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"through","version":"^2.3.6"},{"packageName":"buffer","version":"^3.0.1"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.1.0","timestamp":"2017-05-23T11:12:35.674Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"through","version":"^2.3.6"},{"packageName":"buffer","version":"^3.0.1"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.2.0","timestamp":"2017-05-23T11:26:40.503Z","trustScore":7,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"through","version":"^2.3.6"},{"packageName":"buffer","version":"^3.0.1"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.2.1","timestamp":"2017-05-23T11:37:47.511Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"through","version":"^2.3.6"},{"packageName":"buffer","version":"^3.0.1"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.2.2","timestamp":"2017-05-23T11:48:58.221Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"through","version":"^2.3.6"},{"packageName":"buffer","version":"^3.0.1"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.2.3","timestamp":"2017-05-23T11:55:55.721Z","trustScore":7,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"through","version":"^2.3.6"},{"packageName":"buffer","version":"^3.0.1"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.2.4","timestamp":"2017-05-23T11:59:00.576Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"through","version":"^2.3.6"},{"packageName":"buffer","version":"^3.0.1"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.2.5","timestamp":"2017-07-24T07:54:44.558Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"through","version":"^2.3.6"},{"packageName":"buffer","version":"^3.0.1"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.3.0","timestamp":"2018-09-17T10:36:54.551Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"through","version":"^2.3.6"},{"packageName":"buffer","version":"^3.0.1"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.3.1","timestamp":"2018-10-09T07:39:14.157Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"through","version":"^2.3.6"},{"packageName":"buffer","version":"^3.0.1"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.3.2","timestamp":"2019-02-02T06:11:37.905Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"through","version":"^2.3.6"},{"packageName":"buffer","version":"^3.0.1"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.3.3","timestamp":"2019-02-08T15:11:06.088Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"buffer","version":"^5.2.1"},{"packageName":"through","version":"^2.3.8"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.4.0","timestamp":"2020-04-01T07:00:41.883Z","trustScore":15,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"buffer","version":"^5.2.1"},{"packageName":"through","version":"^2.3.8"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.4.1","timestamp":"2020-04-09T14:09:41.253Z","trustScore":15,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"buffer","version":"^5.2.1"},{"packageName":"through","version":"^2.3.8"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.4.2","times
