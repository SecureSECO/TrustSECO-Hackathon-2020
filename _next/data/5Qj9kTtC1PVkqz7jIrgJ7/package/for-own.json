Exit early by returning `false`. JavaScript/Node.js.\n\n## Install\n\nInstall with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):\n\n```sh\n$ npm install --save for-own\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nvar forOwn = require('for-own');\n\nvar obj = {a: 'foo', b: 'bar', c: 'baz'};\nvar values = [];\nvar keys = [];\n\nforOwn(obj, function (value, key, o) {\n  keys.push(key);\n  values.push(value);\n});\n\nconsole.log(keys);\n//=> ['a', 'b', 'c'];\n\nconsole.log(values);\n//=> ['foo', 'bar', 'baz'];\n```\n\n## About\n\n### Related projects\n\n* [arr-flatten](https://www.npmjs.com/package/arr-flatten): Recursively flatten an array or arrays.
