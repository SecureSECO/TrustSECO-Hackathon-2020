{"pageProps":{"postData":{"_id":"5fb667fa9f9e7f16fd324998","id":"requireindex","crawlTimestamp":"19/11/2020 12:41:29","packageName":"requireindex","description":"Write minimal node index.js files that require and export siblings by file basename","repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/stephenhandley/requireindex.git"},"readme":"# Description\n\nWrite minimal node index.js files that require and export siblings by file basename\n\n# Latest Version\n\n1.2.0\n\n# Installation\n```\nnpm install requireindex\n```\n\nor in package.json\n\n```json\n{\n  ...\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"requireindex\": \"1.1.x\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n# Usage\nCheck the [test directory](https://github.com/stephenhandley/requireindex/tree/master/test) for example usage. The [test/lib](https://github.com/stephenhandley/requireindex/tree/master/test/lib) looks like:\n\n```\nlib/\n  index.js\n  Foo.js\n  bar/\n    index.js\n    f.js\n    fing.js\n    fed/\n      again.js\n      ignored.js\n      index.js\n      somemore.js\n  bam.js\n  _private.js\n\n```\n\nThe index.js files in [test/lib/](https://github.com/stephenhandley/requireindex/tree/master/test/lib/index.js) and [test/lib/bar/](https://github.com/stephenhandley/requireindex/tree/master/test/lib/bar/index.js) contain:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = require('requireindex')(__dirname);\n```\n\nand the index.js file in [test/lib/bar/fed/](https://github.com/stephenhandley/requireindex/tree/master/test/lib/bar/fed/index.js) contains:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = require('requireindex')(__dirname, ['again', 'somemore']);\n```\n\nThe optional second argument allows you to explicitly specify the required files using their basename. In this example [test/lib/bar/fed/ignored.js](https://github.com/stephenhandley/requireindex/tree/master/test/lib/bar/fed/ignored.js) is not included as a public module. The other way to make a module/file private without the need for explicitly naming all the other included files is to prefix the filename with an underscore, as demonstrated by [test/lib/_private.js](https://github.com/stephenhandley/requireindex/tree/master/test/lib/_private.js) which is not exported.\n\nSo, with these index.js files, the result of\n\n```js\nrequire('lib');\n```\n\nis:\n\n```js\n{\n  bam: {\n    m: [Function],\n    n: [Function]\n  },\n  bar: {\n    f: [Function],\n    fed: {\n      again: [Function],\n      somemore: [Function]\n    },\n    fing: [Function]\n  },\n  Foo: {\n    l: [Function],\n    ls: [Function]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#Build status\n[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/stephenhandley/requireindex.png)](http://travis-ci.org/stephenhandley/requireindex)\n","homepage":"https://github.com/stephenhandley/requireindex","trustScore":21,"sourceRank":{"basic_info_present":1,"repository_present":1,"readme_present":1,"license_present":1,"versions_present":1,"follows_semver":1,"recent_release":0,"not_brand_new":1,"one_point_oh":1,"dependent_projects":6,"dependent_repositories":4,"stars":2,"contributors":0,"subscribers":1,"all_prereleases":0,"any_outdated_dependencies":0,"is_deprecated":0,"is_unmaintained":0,"is_removed":0,"trustScore":21},"versions":[{"versionNumber":"0.0.1","timestamp":"2012-05-01T02:16:39.296Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.2","timestamp":"2012-05-01T07:49:32.728Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.0","timestamp":"2012-05-04T01:20:32.152Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.1","timestamp":"2012-05-04T02:27:42.077Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.2","timestamp":"2012-05-04T02:40:32.649Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.3","timestamp":"2012-05-04T03:01:27.202Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.4","timestamp":"2012-05-06T09:42:10.788Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.5","timestamp":"2012-05-30T20:04:15.834Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.6","timestamp":"2012-05-31T19:29:48.477Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.7","timestamp":"2012-06-05T21:54:39.913Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.8","timestamp":"2012-09-05T19:39:56.441Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.0","timestamp":"2012-09-26T21:13:56.402Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.1","timestamp":"2013-05-01T03:25:57.135Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.1.0","timestamp":"2014-01-17T22:12:53.051Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.2.0","timestamp":"2018-02-10T21:12:52.631Z","trustScore":21,"dependencies":[]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
