Also removing `WhiteSpace` tokens that\nare at the beginning of the line to avoid mistakes.\n\n```js\n// sanitize a single node\nsanitize(node);\n// sanitize whole AST\nsanitize(ast);\n```\n\n### updateBlockComment(token)\n\nUpdates `BlockComment` `raw` value to make sure all the lines have the same\n`Indent` level.\n\nThis is called internally by the `addLevel` and `indentInBetween` methods (if\nfirst token of line is a `BlockComment`), so as long as you only use those\nmethods to edit the indent level you shouldn't need to call this.\n\n### alignComments(astOrNode)\n\nAlign all the comments based on the next/previous lines inside a given `ast` or\n`node`.\n\nIt will align the comments with the next line unless the comment block is\nfollowed by an empty line, in that case it will use the previous non-empty line\nas a reference.\n\nExample output:\n\n```js\n// aligned with next line\nswitch (foo) {\n  // aligned with next non-empty line\n\n  case bar:\n    // aligned with next line\n    baz();\n    // this should be aligned with previous line since comment block is\n    // followed by an empty line\n\n  // aligned with next line\n  case biz:\n    // aligned with next line\n    what();\n// aligned with next line\n}\n\nfunction noop() {\n  // indented since it's inside an empty block\n}\n\n// aligned with previous line since it's at the end of program\n```\n\n### whiteSpaceToIndent(token, [indentValue])\n\nConvert `WhiteSpace` token into `Indent` if it's the first token of the line.\n\nYou can pass a custom `indentValue` or it will use the value set by\n`setOptions()` to calculate the indent `level` (basically count how many times\nthis string repeats inside the `token.value`).\n\n```js\nvar token = {\n  type: 'WhiteSpace',\n  value: '\\t\\t\\t',\n  prev: { type: 'LineBreak', value: '\\n' }\n};\nwhiteSpaceToIndent(token, '\\t');\n// edits properties in place\nconsole.log(token.type);  // > \"Indent\"\nconsole.log(token.level); // > 3\n```\n\nThis is useful in case you want to make sure `sanitize` won't remove the\noriginal indents.\n\n## Debug\n\nThis module uses [debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) internally. To\nmake it easier to identify what is wrong we sometimes run the esformatter tests\nwith a `DEBUG` flag, like:\n\n```sh\nDEBUG=rocambole:indent npm test\n```\n\n## License\n\nReleased under the MIT License\n\n","homepage":"https://github.com/millermedeiros/rocambole-indent","trustScore":11,"sourceRank":{"basic_info_present":1,"repository_present":1,"readme_present":1,"license_present":1,"versions_present":1,"follows_semver":1,"recent_release":0,"not_brand_new":1,"one_point_oh":1,"dependent_projects":2,"dependent_repositories":2,"stars":0,"contributors":0,"subscribers":0,"all_prereleases":0,"any_outdated_dependencies":-1,"is_deprecated":0,"is_unmaintained":0,"is_removed":0,"trustScore":11},"versions":[{"versionNumber":"0.1.0","timestamp":"2015-03-20T05:52:21.073Z","trustScore":5,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"debug","version":"^2.1.3"},{"packageName":"mout","version":"^0.11.0"},{"packageName":"rocambole-token","version":"^1.2.1"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.2.0","timestamp":"2015-03-20T19:27:05.966Z","trustScore":5,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"debug","version":"^2.1.3"},{"packageName":"mout","version":"^0.11.0"},{"packageName":"rocambole-token","version":"^1.2.1"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.0","timestamp":"2015-03-24T15:36:49.634Z","trustScore":4,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"debug","version":"^2.1.3"},{"packageName":"mout","version":"^0.11.0"},{"packageName":"rocambole-token","version":"^1.2.1"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.1.0","timestamp":"2015-03-25T19:34:29.482Z","trustScore":5,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"debug","version":"^2.1.3"},{"packageName":"mout","version":"^0.11.0"},{"packageName":"rocambole-token","version":"^1.2.1"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.1.1","timestamp":"2015-03-25T20:03:26.468Z","trustScore":5,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"debug","version":"^2.1.3"},{"packageName":"mout","version":"^0.11.0"},{"packageName":"rocambole-token","version":"^1.2.1"}]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.0","timestamp":"2015-03-25T20:09:05.067Z","trustScore":5,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"debug","version":"^2.1.3"},{"packageName":"mout","version":"^0.11.0"},{"packageName":"rocambole-token","version":"^1.2.1"}]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.1","timestamp":"2015-03-25T20:18:09.960Z","trustScore":5,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"debug","version":"^2.1.3"},{"packageName":"mout","version":"^0.11.0"},{"packageName":"rocambole-token","version":"^1.2.1"}]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.2","timestamp":"2015-03-25T22:29:10.719Z","trustScore":5,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"debug","version":"^2.1.3"},{"packageName":"mout","version":"^0.11.0"},{"packageName":"rocambole-token","version":"^1.2.1"}]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.3","timestamp":"2015-03-27T19:32:56.292Z","trustScore":5,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"debug","version":"^2.1.3"},{"packageName":"mout","version":"^0.11.0"},{"packageName":"rocambole-token","version":"^1.2.1"}]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.4","timestamp":"2015-05-02T20:23:24.359Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"debug","version":"^2.1.3"},{"packageName":"mout","version":"^0.11.0"},{"packageName":"rocambole-token","version":"^1.2.1"}]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
