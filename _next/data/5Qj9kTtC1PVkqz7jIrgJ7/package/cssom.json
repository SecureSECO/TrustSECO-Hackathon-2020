It is also a partial implementation of [CSS Object Model](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/cssom/). \n\n    CSSOM.parse(\"body {color: black}\")\n    -> {\n      cssRules: [\n        {\n          selectorText: \"body\",\n          style: {\n            0: \"color\",\n            color: \"black\",\n            length: 1\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n\n\n## [Parser demo](http://nv.github.com/CSSOM/docs/parse.html)\n\nWorks well in Google Chrome 6+, Safari 5+, Firefox 3.6+, Opera 10.63+.\nDoesn't work in IE < 9 because of unsupported getters/setters.\n\nTo use CSSOM.js in the browser you might want to build a one-file version that exposes a single `CSSOM` global variable:\n\n    ➤ git clone https://github.com/NV/CSSOM.git\n    ➤ cd CSSOM\n    ➤ node build.js\n    build/CSSOM.js is done\n\nTo use it with Node.js or any other CommonJS loader:\n\n    ➤ npm install cssom\n\n## Don’t use it if...\n\nYou parse CSS to mungle, minify or reformat code like this:\n\n```css\ndiv {\n  background: gray;\n  background: linear-gradient(to bottom, white 0%, black 100%);\n}\n```\n\nThis pattern is often used to give browsers that don’t understand linear gradients a fallback solution (e.g. gray color in the example).\nIn CSSOM, `background: gray` [gets overwritten](http://nv.github.io/CSSOM/docs/parse.html#css=div%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20background%3A%20gray%3B%0A%20%20%20%20background%3A%20linear-gradient(to%20bottom%2C%20white%200%25%2C%20black%20100%25)%3B%0A%7D).\nIt doesn't get preserved.\n\nIf you do CSS mungling, minification, image inlining, and such, CSSOM.js is no good for you, considere using one of the following:\n\n  * [postcss](https://github.com/postcss/postcss)\n  * [reworkcss/css](https://github.com/reworkcss/css)\n  * [csso](https://github.com/css/csso)\n  * [mensch](https://github.com/brettstimmerman/mensch)\n\n\n## [Tests](http://nv.github.com/CSSOM/spec/)\n\nTo run tests locally:\n\n    ➤ git submodule init\n    ➤ git submodule update\n\n\n## [Who uses CSSOM.js](https://github.com/NV/CSSOM/wiki/Who-uses-CSSOM.js)\n","homepage":"https://github.com/NV/CSSOM#readme","trustScore":22,"sourceRank":{"basic_info_present":1,"repository_present":1,"readme_present":1,"license_present":1,"versions_present":1,"follows_semver":1,"recent_release":0,"not_brand_new":1,"one_point_oh":0,"dependent_projects":4,"dependent_repositories":5,"stars":3,"contributors":1,"subscribers":2,"all_prereleases":0,"any_outdated_dependencies":0,"is_deprecated":0,"is_unmaintained":0,"is_removed":0,"trustScore":22},"versions":[{"versionNumber":"0.2.0","timestamp":"2011-10-24T21:58:20.263Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.2.1","timestamp":"2011-11-20T12:18:49.773Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.2.2","timestamp":"2012-01-04T22:33:00.885Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.2.3","timestamp":"2012-02-18T14:10:14.717Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.2.4","timestamp":"2012-06-26T14:13:39.119Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.2.5","timestamp":"2012-07-15T22:21:54.083Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.3.0","timestamp":"2013-11-09T02:58:33.931Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.3.1","timestamp":"2016-02-01T00:37:48.624Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.3.2","timestamp":"2017-01-20T23:52:41.684Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.3.3","timestamp":"2018-06-28T18:15:42.549Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.3.4","timestamp":"2018-07-03T07:17:00.381Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.3.5","timestamp":"2019-02-05T01:48:56.443Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.3.6","timestamp":"2019-02-05T01:59:04.845Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.3.7","timestamp":"2019-07-04T02:29:05.209Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.3.8","timestamp":"2019-07-04T02:33:14.137Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.4.0","timestamp":"2019-07-04T02:46:50.862Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.4.1","timestamp":"2019-07-04T03:18:57.815Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.4.2","timestamp":"2019-11-11T03:09:46.503Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.4.3","timestamp":"2019-11-13T23:33:55.281Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.4.4","timestamp":"2019-11-14T00:40:05.800Z","trustScore":22,"dependencies":[]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
