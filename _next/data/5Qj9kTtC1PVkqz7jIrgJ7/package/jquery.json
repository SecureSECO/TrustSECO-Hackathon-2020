This includes notable differences from the previous version and a more readable changelog.\n\n## Including jQuery\n\nBelow are some of the most common ways to include jQuery.\n\n### Browser\n\n#### Script tag\n\n```html\n<script src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\n#### Babel\n\n[Babel](https://babeljs.io/) is a next generation JavaScript compiler. One of the features is the ability to use ES6/ES2015 modules now, even though browsers do not yet support this feature natively.\n\n```js\nimport $ from \"jquery\";\n```\n\n#### Browserify/Webpack\n\nThere are several ways to use [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) and [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/). For more information on using these tools, please refer to the corresponding project's documentation. In the script, including jQuery will usually look like this...\n\n```js\nvar $ = require( \"jquery\" );\n```\n\n#### AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition)\n\nAMD is a module format built for the browser. For more information, we recommend [require.js' documentation](https://requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.html).\n\n```js\ndefine( [ \"jquery\" ], function( $ ) {\n\n} );\n```\n\n### Node\n\nTo include jQuery in [Node](https://nodejs.org/), first install with npm.\n\n```sh\nnpm install jquery\n```\n\nFor jQuery to work in Node, a window with a document is required. Since no such window exists natively in Node, one can be mocked by tools such as [jsdom](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom). This can be useful for testing purposes.\n\n```js\nconst { JSDOM } = require( \"jsdom\" );\nconst { window } = new JSDOM( \"\" );\nconst $ = require( \"jquery\" )( window );\n```\n","homepage":"https://jquery.com","trustScore":29,"sourceRank":{"basic_info_present":1,"repository_present":1,"readme_present":1,"license_present":1,"versions_present":1,"follows_semver":1,"recent_release":0,"not_brand_new":1,"one_point_oh":1,"dependent_projects":8,"dependent_repositories":5,"stars":5,"contributors":1,"subscribers":2,"all_prereleases":0,"any_outdated_dependencies":0,"is_deprecated":0,"is_unmaintained":0,"is_removed":0,"trustScore":29},"versions":[{"versionNumber":"1.5.1","timestamp":"2011-03-19T07:19:56.956Z","trustScore":14,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"jsdom","version":"=0.1.20"},{"packageName":"htmlparser","version":">=
