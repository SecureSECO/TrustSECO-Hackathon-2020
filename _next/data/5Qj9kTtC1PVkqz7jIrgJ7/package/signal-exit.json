That is, there are no other listeners, and\nit is a fatal signal.\n\n## Options\n\n* `alwaysLast`: Run this handler after any other signal or exit\n  handlers.  This causes `process.emit` to be monkeypatched.\n","homepage":"https://github.com/tapjs/signal-exit","trustScore":25,"sourceRank":{"basic_info_present":1,"repository_present":1,"readme_present":1,"license_present":1,"versions_present":1,"follows_semver":1,"recent_release":0,"not_brand_new":1,"one_point_oh":1,"dependent_projects":6,"dependent_repositories":6,"stars":2,"contributors":1,"subscribers":2,"all_prereleases":0,"any_outdated_dependencies":0,"is_deprecated":0,"is_unmaintained":0,"is_removed":0,"trustScore":25},"versions":[{"versionNumber":"1.0.0","timestamp":"2015-05-16T06:45:54.221Z","trustScore":12,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.1","timestamp":"2015-05-16T07:06:50.535Z","trustScore":12,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.1.0","timestamp":"2015-05-16T19:20:17.735Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.2.0","timestamp":"2015-05-18T01:45:01.230Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.3.0","timestamp":"2015-05-19T04:50:16.726Z","trustScore":12,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.3.1","timestamp":"2015-05-20T15:48:08.812Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.1.0","timestamp":"2015-05-25T02:45:00.437Z","trustScore":12,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.1.1","timestamp":"2015-05-25T06:01:08.097Z","trustScore":12,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.0","timestamp":"2015-05-25T09:53:31.879Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.1.2","timestamp":"2015-05-25T10:07:11.052Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"3.0.0-candidate","timestamp":"2016-06-10T16:14:07.934Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"3.0.0","timestamp":"2016-06-13T22:35:49.825Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"3.0.1","timestamp":"2016-09-08T17:13:05.740Z","trustScore":12,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"3.0.2","timestamp":"2016-12-04T03:21:02.792Z","trustScore":12,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"3.0.3","timestamp":"2020-03-26T19:32:54.645Z","trustScore":25,"dependencies":[]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
