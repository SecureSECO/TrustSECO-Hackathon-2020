(`write` always returns `!this.paused`).\n\nThis function is the basis for most of the synchronous streams in \n[event-stream](http://github.com/dominictarr/event-stream).\n\n``` js\nvar through = require('through')\n\nthrough(function write(data) {\n    this.queue(data) //data *must* not be null\n  },\n  function end () { //optional\n    this.queue(null)\n  })\n```\n\nOr, can also be used _without_ buffering on pause, use `this.emit('data', data)`,\nand this.emit('end')\n\n``` js\nvar through = require('through')\n\nthrough(function write(data) {\n    this.emit('data', data)\n    //this.pause() \n  },\n  function end () { //optional\n    this.emit('end')\n  })\n```\n\n## Extended Options\n\nYou will probably not need these 99% of the time.\n\n### autoDestroy=false\n\nBy default, `through` emits close when the writable\nand readable side of the stream has ended.\nIf that is not desired, set `autoDestroy=false`.\n\n``` js\nvar through = require('through')\n\n//like this\nvar ts = through(write, end, {autoDestroy: false})\n//or like this\nvar ts = through(write, end)\nts.autoDestroy = false\n```\n\n## License\n\nMIT / Apache2\n","homepage":"https://github.com/dominictarr/through","trustScore":28,"sourceRank":{"basic_info_present":1,"repository_present":1,"readme_present":1,"license_present":1,"versions_present":1,"follows_semver":1,"recent_release":0,"not_brand_new":1,"one_point_oh":1,"dependent_projects":8,"dependent_repositories":6,"stars":3,"contributors":1,"subscribers":2,"all_prereleases":0,"any_outdated_dependencies":0,"is_deprecated":0,"is_unmaintained":0,"is_removed":0,"trustScore":28},"versions":[{"versionNumber":"0.0.1","timestamp":"2012-07-04T14:09:48.188Z","trustScore":12,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.2","timestamp":"2012-07-04T14:14:38.160Z","trustScore":12,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.3","timestamp":"2012-07-04T14:55:22.509Z","trustScore":12,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.4","timestamp":"2012-07-12T03:04:45.402Z","trustScore":13,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.0","timestamp":"2012-07-22T18:12:52.947Z","trustScore":13,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.1","timestamp":"2012-07-22T19:24:58.408Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.2","timestamp":"2012-07-22T20:56:34.166Z","trustScore":14,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.3","timestamp":"2012-08-07T01:43:12.512Z","trustScore":13,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.4","timestamp":"2012-08-07T15:49:31.336Z","trustScore":13,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.0","timestamp":"2012-08-31T09:38:50.600Z","trustScore":14,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.1.0","timestamp":"2012-09-15T11:48:53.613Z","trustScore":12,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.1.1","timestamp":"2012-10-11T13:49:59.968Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.1.2","timestamp":"2012-11-20T17:56:39.995Z","trustScore":12,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.0","timestamp":"2012-11-26T05:30:11.797Z","trustScore":13,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.1.0","timestamp":"2012-11-28T06:56:46.753Z","trustScore":14,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.2.0","timestamp":"2013-02-11T08:24:48.695Z","trustScore":13,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.2.1","timestamp":"2013-03-03T02:09:41.237Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.2.2","timestamp":"2013-03-12T05:18:11.703Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.2.4","timestamp":"2013-03-13T07:45:07.144Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.2.5","timestamp":"2013-03-13T08:39:33.743Z","trustScore":14,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.2.6","timestamp":"2013-03-13T08:44:43.459Z","trustScore":12,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.2.7","timestamp":"2013-03-15T05:52:05.447Z","trustScore":13,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.3.1","timestamp":"2013-04-13T10:57:25.016Z","trustScore":13,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.3.2","timestamp":"2013-04-24T15:28:51.858Z","trustScore":13,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.3.3","timestamp":"2013-04-24T22:56:02.409Z","trustScore":14,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.3.4","timestamp":"2013-04-29T08:35:05.575Z","trustScore":14,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.3.6","timestamp":"2014-09-16T07:00:00.673Z","trustScore":12,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.3.7","timestamp":"2015-04-06T05:00:51.802Z","trustScore":12,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.3.8","timestamp":"2015-07-03T13:38:39.650Z","trustScore":28,"dependencies":[]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
