//true\n\n//from string-extended\n_.format(\"{first} {last}\", {first : \"Bob\", last : \"yukon\"});\n\n//combination of object-extended, array-extended, and string-extended\n_({hello : \"hello\", world: \"world\"}).keys().map(function(key, index){\n    return _.format(\"%d key is %s\", index + 1, key);\n}).value().join(\";\"); //\"1 key is hello; 2 key is world\"\n\n\n```\n\nIf you want to namespace you API you can provide an alias.\n\n\n\n```javascript\n\nvar _ = extended()\n            .register(\"array\", require(\"array-extended\"))\n            .register(\"string\", require(\"string-extended\"))\n            .register(\"date\", require(\"date-extended\"))\n            .register(\"fn\", require(\"function-extended\"))\n            .register(\"is\", require(\"is-extended\"))\n            .register(\"obj\", require(\"object-extended\"))\n            .register(\"promise\", require(\"promise-extended\"));\n\n//now use your API!\n\n//from is-extended\n_.is.isArray([]); //true\n\n//from string-extended\n_.string.format(\"{first} {last}\", {first : \"Bob\", last : \"yukon\"});\n\n```\n\n### Integration with other libraries.\n\nYou can also integrate other libraries by just mixing in their functions.\n\nSuppose you dont want to use `promise-extended` but instead `Q`.\n\n```javascript\nvar _ = extended()\n            .register(require(\"array-extended\"))\n            .register(require(\"string-extended\"))\n            .register(require(\"date-extended\"))\n            .register(require(\"function-extended\"))\n            .register(require(\"is-extended\"))\n            .register(require(\"object-extended\"))\n            .register(require(\"q\"));\n\n_.resolve(\"hello\").then(function(hello){\n    console.log(\"hello\");\n})\n```\n\nOr maybe you want to continue to use `underscore` with added functionality.\n\n```javascript\n\n//lets create a library with _, promises and an inheritance library.\nvar _ = extended()\n            .register(require(\"_\"))\n            .register(require(\"is-extended\"))\n            .register(require(\"promise-extended\"))\n            .register(require(\"declare.js\"));\n\nvar Person = _.declare({\n    constructor: function(firstName, lastName){\n        this.firstName = firstName;\n        this.lastName = lastName;\n    }\n});\n\nvar\n\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","homepage":"https://github.com/doug-martin/extended","trustScore":12,"sourceRank":{"basic_info_present":1,"repository_present":1,"readme_present":1,"license_present":1,"versions_present":1,"follows_semver":1,"recent_release":0,"not_brand_new":1,"one_point_oh":0,"dependent_projects":2,"dependent_repositories":3,"stars":0,"contributors":0,"subscribers":0,"all_prereleases":0,"any_outdated_dependencies":0,"is_deprecated":0,"is_unmaintained":0,"is_removed":0,"trustScore":12},"versions":[{"versionNumber":"0.0.1","timestamp":"2013-01-16T21:24:38.272Z","trustScore":6,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"extender","version":"0.0.4"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.2","timestamp":"2013-01-17T04:03:35.237Z","trustScore":6,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"extender","version":"0.0.4"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.3","timestamp":"2013-01-22T06:16:44.186Z","trustScore":5,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"extender","version":"~0.0.5"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.4","timestamp":"2013-04-16T15:57:30.343Z","trustScore":6,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"extender","version":"~0.0.5"},{"packageName":"grunt","version":"~0.4.1"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.5","timestamp":"2013-06-05T05:41:12.808Z","trustScore":6,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"extender","version":"~0.0.5"},{"packageName":"grunt","version":"~0.4.1"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.6","timestamp":"2014-04-01T18:00:48.768Z","trustScore":12,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"extender","version":"~0.0.5"}]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
