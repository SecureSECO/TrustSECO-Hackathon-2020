This module calls\n`gettimeofday(2)` to get the time in microseconds and provides it in a few\ndifferent formats. The same warning from that function applies:\n_The resolution of the system clock is hardware dependent, and the time may\nbe updated continuously or in ``ticks.''_\n\n## N-API Support\n\nAs of version `3.0.0`, this library is built using the [N-API](https://nodejs.org/api/n-api.html) library. This should allow you to upgrade to newer versions of Node.js without having to reinstall / rebuild this library.\n\nVersion `3.0.0` and later also bundle prebuilt binaries for common systems in\nthe npm package itself. These will be used if the version of Node you are using\nsupports N-API ([>= v6.14.2](https://nodejs.org/api/n-api.html#n_api_n_api_version_matrix)), otherwise the binary will be recompiled on install.\n\n# Installation\n\n    npm install microtime\n\n# Usage\n\n### microtime.now()\n\nGet the current time in microseconds as an integer.\n\n### microtime.nowDouble()\n\nGet the current time in seconds as a floating point number with microsecond\naccuracy (similar to `time.time()` in Python and `Time.now.to_f` in Ruby).\n\n### microtime.nowStruct()\n\nGet the current time and return as a list with seconds and microseconds (matching the return value of `gettimeofday(2)`).\n\n# Example\n\n    > var microtime = require('microtime')\n    > microtime.now()\n    1297448895297028\n    > microtime.nowDouble()\n    1297448897.600976\n    > microtime.nowStruct()\n    [ 1297448902, 753875 ]\n\n## Estimating clock resolution\n\nStarting with version 0.1.3, there is a test script that tries to guess the clock resolution. You can run it with `npm test microtime`. Example output:\n\n    microtime.now() = 1298960083489806\n    microtime.nowDouble() = 1298960083.511521\n    microtime.nowStruct() = [ 1298960083, 511587 ]\n\n    Guessing clock resolution...\n
