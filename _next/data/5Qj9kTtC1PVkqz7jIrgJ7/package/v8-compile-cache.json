The \"code cache\" is the work of parsing and compiling done by V8.\n\nThe ability to tap into V8 to produce/consume this cache was introduced in [Node v5.7.0](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v5.7.0/).\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Add the dependency:\n\n  ```sh\n  $ npm install --save v8-compile-cache\n  ```\n\n2. Then, in your entry module add:\n\n  ```js\n  require('v8-compile-cache');\n  ```\n\n**Requiring `v8-compile-cache` in Node <5.7.0 is a noop â€“ but you need at least Node 4.0.0 to support the ES2015 syntax used by `v8-compile-cache`.**\n\n## Options\n\nSet the environment variable `DISABLE_V8_COMPILE_CACHE=1` to disable the cache.\n\nCache directory is defined by environment variable `V8_COMPILE_CACHE_CACHE_DIR` or defaults to `<os.tmpdir()>/v8-compile-cache-<V8_VERSION>`.\n\n## Internals\n\nCache files are suffixed `.BLOB` and `.MAP` corresponding to the entry module that required `v8-compile-cache`. The cache is _entry module specific_ because it is faster to load the entire code cache into memory at once, than it is to read it from disk on a file-by-file basis.\n\n## Benchmarks\n\nSee https://github.com/zertosh/v8-compile-cache/tree/master/bench.\n\n**Load Times:**\n\n| Module           | Without Cache | With Cache |\n| ---------------- | -------------:| ----------:|\n| `babel-core`     | `218ms`       | `185ms`    |\n| `yarn`           | `153ms`       | `113ms`    |\n| `yarn` (bundled) | `228ms`       | `105ms`    |\n\n_^ Includes the overhead of loading the cache itself._\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\n* `FileSystemBlobStore` and `NativeCompileCache` are based on Atom's implementation of their v8 compile cache: \n  - https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/b0d7a8a/src/file-system-blob-store.js\n  - https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/b0d7a8a/src/native-compile-cache.js\n* `mkdirpSync` is based on:\n  - https://github.com/substack/node-mkdirp/blob/f2003bb/index.js#L55-L98\n","homepage":"https://github.com/zertosh/v8-compile-cache#readme","trustScore":24,"sourceRank":{"basic_info_present":1,"repository_present":1,"readme_present":1,"license_present":1,"versions_present":1,"follows_semver":1,"recent_release":1,"not_brand_new":1,"one_point_oh":1,"dependent_projects":4,"dependent_repositories":5,"stars":3,"contributors":1,"subscribers":2,"all_prereleases":0,"any_outdated_dependencies":0,"is_deprecated":0,"is_unmaintained":0,"is_removed":0,"trustScore":24},"versions":[{"versionNumber":"1.0.0","timestamp":"2017-02-22T01:13:50.544Z","trustScore":12,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.1.0","timestamp":"2017-03-27T20:01:24.028Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.1.1","timestamp":"2018-01-23T18:38:32.903Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.1.2","timestamp":"2018-01-23T20:04:38.262Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.0","timestamp":"2018-04-30T18:16:11.874Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.1","timestamp":"2018-08-07T03:23:06.648Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.2","timestamp":"2018-08-07T03:49:40.380Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.3","timestamp":"2019-05-10T19:40:37.711Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.1.0","timestamp":"2019-08-04T22:57:32.308Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.1.1","timestamp":"2020-05-30T20:44:38.916Z","trustScore":22,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.2.0","timestamp":"2020-10-28T18:51:57.806Z","trustScore":24,"dependencies":[]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
