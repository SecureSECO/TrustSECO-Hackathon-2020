If any of them passes, it will not be copied.\nIf you give it a `function`, it will use that with `Array.filter` on the list of full absolute pathnames of files and directories.\n\n\nCLI\n---\n\n`cpr` can also be used from the command line which is useful for cross platform support.\n\nUsage:\n\n```\ncpr <source> <destination> [options]\n```\nCopies files from `source` to `destination`.\n\nOptions:\n\n* `-d`, `--delete-first`:             Delete the destination directory before copying.\n* `-f <regex>`, `--filter <regex>`:   Filter out any items that match `<regex>`, a case-insensitive regex pattern.\n* `-h`, `--help`:                     Display this usage info.\n* `-o`, `--overwrite`:                Overwrite the destination exists if it exists.\n* `-v`, `--version`:                  Display the cpr version.\n\nNote that the CLI's `filter` option is simpler than the original NodeJS API, only accepting case-insensitive regular expression patterns and not functions.\n\n![cpr](../master/cpr.jpg?raw=true)\n","homepage":"https://github.com/davglass/cpr#readme","trustScore":20,"sourceRank":{"basic_info_present":1,"repository_present":1,"readme_present":1,"license_present":1,"versions_present":1,"follows_semver":1,"recent_release":0,"not_brand_new":1,"one_point_oh":1,"dependent_projects":6,"dependent_repositories":3,"stars":2,"contributors":1,"subscribers":1,"all_prereleases":0,"any_outdated_dependencies":-1,"is_deprecated":0,"is_unmaintained":0,"is_removed":0,"trustScore":20},"versions":[{"versionNumber":"0.0.1","timestamp":"2012-10-04T19:43:03.947Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"graceful-fs","version":"~1.1.14"},{"packageName":"rimraf","version":"~2.0.2"},{"packageName":"mkdirp","version":"~0.3.4"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.2","timestamp":"2012-10-05T15:00:53.738Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"graceful-fs","version":"~1.1.14"},{"packageName":"rimraf","version":"~2.0.2"},{"packageName":"mkdirp","version":"~0.3.4"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.3","timestamp":"2012-10-05T21:26:31.137Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"graceful-fs","version":"~1.1.14"},{"packageName":"rimraf","version":"~2.0.2"},{"packageName":"mkdirp","version":"~0.3.4"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.4","timestamp":"2012-10-15T17:20:22.711Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"graceful-fs","version":"~1.1.14"},{"packageName":"rimraf","version":"~2.0.2"},{"packageName":"mkdirp","version":"~0.3.4"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.5","timestamp":"2012-10-19T13:38:23.483Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"graceful-fs","version":"~1.1.14"},{"packageName":"rimraf","version":"~2.0.2"},{"packageName":"mkdirp","version":"~0.3.4"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.6","timestamp":"2012-10-19T16:00:52.205Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"graceful-fs","version":"~1.1.14"},{"packageName":"rimraf","version":"~2.0.2"},{"packageName":"mkdirp","version":"~0.3.4"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.0","timestamp":"2013-02-26T17:51:12.599Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"graceful-fs","version":"~1.2.0"},{"packageName":"rimraf","version":"~2.0.2"},{"packageName":"mkdirp","version":"~0.3.4"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.1","timestamp":"2013-07-10T19:06:25.348Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"graceful-fs","version":"~1.2.0"},{"packageName":"rimraf","version":"~2.0.2"},{"packageName":"mkdirp","version":"~0.3.4"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.2.0","timestamp":"2014-05-13T13:33:20.693Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"graceful-fs","version":"~1.2.0"},{"packageName":"rimraf","version":"~2.0.2"},{"packageName":"mkdirp","version":"~0.3.4"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.3.0","timestamp":"2014-06-30T14:11:47.845Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"graceful-fs","version":"~1.2.0"},{"packageName":"rimraf","version":"~2.0.2"},{"packageName":"mkdirp","version":"~0.3.4"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.3.1","timestamp":"2014-07-02T01:10:12.462Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"graceful-fs","version":"~1.2.0"},{"packageName":"rimraf","version":"~2.0.2"},{"packageName":"mkdirp","version":"~0.3.4"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.3.2","timestamp":"2014-07-02T20:53:35.885Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"graceful-fs","version":"~1.2.0"},{"packageName":"rimraf","version":"~2.0.2"},{"packageName":"mkdirp","version":"~0.3.4"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.3.3","timestamp":"2015-02-10T15:02:39.001Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"graceful-fs","version":"~3.0.5"},{"packageName":"mkdirp","version":"~0.5.0"},{"packageName":"rimraf","version":"~2.2.8"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.4.0","timestamp":"2015-02-15T14:19:01.113Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"graceful-fs","version":"~3.0.5"},{"packageName":"mkdirp","version":"~0.5.0"},{"packageName":"rimraf","version":"~2.2.8"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.4.1","timestamp":"2015-05-26T15:48:21.470Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"graceful-fs","version":"~3.0.5"},{"packageName":"mkdirp","version":"~0.5.0"},{"packageName":"rimraf","version":"~2.2.8"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.4.2","timestamp":"2015-09-12T14:43:28.274Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"graceful-fs","version":"~4.1.2"},{"packageName":"mkdirp","version":"~0.5.0"},{"packageName":"rimraf","version":"~2.4.3"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.4.3","timestamp":"2015-10-11T21:02:05.527Z","trustScore":7,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"graceful-fs","version":"~4.1.2"},{"packageName":"mkdirp","version":"~0.5.0"},{"packageName":"rimraf","version":"~2.4.3"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.0","timestamp":"2015-11-13T00:44:52.445Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"graceful-fs","version":"~4.1.2"},{"packageName":"mkdirp","version":"~0.5.0"},{"packageName":"rimraf","version":"~2.4.3"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.1.0","timestamp":"2016-04-05T13:35:34.705Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"graceful-fs","version":"~4.1.2"},{"packageName":"mkdirp","version":"~0.5.0"},{"packageName":"rimraf","version":"~2.4.3"}]},{"v
