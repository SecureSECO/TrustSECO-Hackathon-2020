Sets up event listeners to infer if the stream is being used as a `Transform` or `Writeable` stream and sinks it on `nextTick` if necessary. If the stream is being used as a `Transform` stream but becomes unpiped, it will be sunk. Respects `pipe`, `on('data')` and `on('readable')` handlers.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->\n[downloads-image]: https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/lead.svg?style=flat-square\n[npm-url]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/lead\n[npm-image]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/lead.svg?style=flat-square\n\n[ci-url]: https://github.com/gulpjs/lead/actions?query=workflow:dev\n[ci-image]: https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/gulpjs/lead/dev?style=flat-square\n\n[coveralls-url]: https://coveralls.io/r/gulpjs/lead\n[coveralls-image]: https://img.shields.io/coveralls/gulpjs/lead/master.svg?style=flat-square\n<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->\n","homepage":"https://github.com/gulpjs/lead#readme","trustScore":16,"sourceRank":{"basic_info_present":1,"repository_present":1,"readme_present":1,"license_present":1,"versions_present":1,"follows_semver":1,"recent_release":0,"not_brand_new":1,"one_point_oh":1,"dependent_projects":2,"dependent_repositories":4,"stars":1,"contributors":0,"subscribers":1,"all_prereleases":0,"any_outdated_dependencies":0,"is_deprecated":0,"is_unmaintained":0,"is_removed":0,"trustScore":16},"versions":[{"versionNumber":"0.0.0","timestamp":"2014-10-28T09:22:25.130Z","trustScore":6,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.0","timestamp":"2017-04-28T17:58:35.397Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"flush-write-stream","version":"^1.0.2"}]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.0","timestamp":"2020-04-28T05:37:06.871Z","trustScore":15,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"flush-write-stream","version":"^2.0.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"3.0.0","timestamp":"2020-04-29T00:06:28.473Z","trustScore":16,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"streamx","version":"^2.6.0"}]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
