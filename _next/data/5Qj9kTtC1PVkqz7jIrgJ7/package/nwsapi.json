It has been completely reworked to be easily extended and maintained. It is a right-to-left selector parser and compiler written in pure Javascript with no external dependencies. It was initially thought as a cross browser library to improve event delegation and web page scraping in various frameworks but it has become a popular replacement of the native CSS selection and matching functionality in newer browsers and headless environments.\n\nIt uses [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) to parse CSS selector strings and [metaprogramming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming) to transforms these selector strings into Javascript function resolvers. This process is executed only once for each selector string allowing memoization of the function resolvers and achieving unmatched performances.\n\n## Installation\n\nTo include NWSAPI in a standard web page:\n\n```html\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"nwsapi.js\"></script>\n```\n\nTo include NWSAPI in a standard web page and automatically replace the native QSA:\n\n```html\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"nwsapi.js\" onload=\"NW.Dom.install()\"></script>\n```\n\nTo use NWSAPI with Node.js:\n\n```\n$ npm install nwsapi\n```\n\nNWSAPI currently supports browsers (as a global, `NW.Dom`) and headless environments (as a CommonJS module).\n\n\n## Supported Selectors\n\nHere is a list of all the CSS2/CSS3/CSS4 [Supported selectors](https://github.com/dperini/nwsapi/wiki/CSS-supported-selectors).\n\n\n## Features and Compliance\n\nYou can read more about NWSAPI [features and compliance](https://github.com/dperini/nwsapi/wiki/Features-and-compliance) on the wiki.\n\n\n## API\n\n### DOM Selection\n\n#### `ancestor( selector, context, callback )`\n\nReturns a reference to the nearest ancestor element matching `selector`, starting at `context`. Returns `null` if no element is found. If `callback` is provided, it is invoked for the matched element.\n\n#### `first( selector, context, callback )`\n\nReturns a reference to the first element matching `selector`, starting at `context`. Returns `null` if no element matches. If `callback` is provided, it is invoked for the matched element.\n\n#### `match( selector, element, callback )`\n\nReturns `true` if `element` matches `selector`, starting at `context`; returns `false` otherwise. If `callback` is provided, it is invoked for the matched element.\n\n#### `select( selector, context, callback )`\n\nReturns an array of all the elements matching `selector`, starting at `context`; returns empty `Array` otherwise. If `callback` is provided, it is invoked for each matching element.\n\n\n### DOM Helpers\n\n#### `byId( id, from )`\n\nReturns a reference to the first element with ID `id`, optionally filtered to descendants of the element `from`.\n\n#### `byTag( tag, from )`\n\nReturns an array of elements having the specified tag name `tag`, optionally filtered to descendants of the element `from`.\n\n#### `byClass( class, from )`\n\nReturns an array of elements having the specified class name `class`, optionally filtered to descendants of the element `from`.\n\n\n### Engine Configuration\n\n#### `configure( options )`\n\nThe following is the list of currently available configuration options, their default values and descriptions, they are boolean flags that can be set to `true` or `false`:\n\n* `IDS_DUPES`: true  - true to allow using multiple elements having the same id, false to disallow\n* `LIVECACHE`: true  - true for caching both results and resolvers, false for caching only resolvers\n* `MIXEDCASE`: true  - true to match tag names case insensitive, false to match using case sensitive\n* `LOGERRORS`: true  - true to print errors and warnings to the console, false to mute both of them\n\n\n### Examples on extending the basic functionalities\n\n#### `configure( { <configuration-flag>: [ true | false ] } )`\n\nDisable logging errors/warnings to console, disallow duplicate ids. Example:\n\n```js\nNW.Dom.configure( { LOGERRORS: false, IDS_DUPES: false } );\n```\nNOTE: NW.Dom.configure() without parameters return the current configuration.\n\n#### `registerCombinator( symbol, resolver )`\n\nRegisters a new symbol and its matching resolver in the combinators table. Example:\n\n```js\nNW.Dom.registerCombinator( '^', 'e.parentElement' );\n```\n\n#### `registerOperator( symbol, resolver )`\n\nRegisters a new symbol and its matching resolver in the attribute operators table. Example:\n\n```js\nNW.Dom.registerOperator( '!=', { p1: '^', p2: '$', p3: 'false' } );\n```\n\n#### `registerSelector( name, rexp, func )`\n\nRegisters a new selector, the matching RE and the resolver function, in the selectors table. Example:\n\n```js\nNW.Dom.registerSelector('Controls', /^\\:(control)(.*)/i,\n  (function(global) {\n    return function(match, source, mode, callback) {\n      var status = true;\n      source = 'if(/^(button|input|select|textarea)/i.test(e.nodeName)){' + source + '}';\n      return { 'source': source, 'status': status };\n    };\n  })(this));\n```\n","homepage":"http://javascript.nwbox.com/nwsapi/","trustScore":19,"sourceRank":{"basic_info_present":1,"repository_present":1,"readme_present":1,"license_present":1,"versions_present":1,"follows_semver":1,"recent_release":0,"not_brand_new":1,"one_point_oh":1,"dependent_projects":4,"dependent_repositories":5,"stars":1,"contributors":0,"subscribers":1,"all_prereleases":0,"any_outdated_dependencies":0,"is_deprecated":0,"is_unmaintained":0,"is_removed":0,"trustScore":19},"versions":[{"versionNumber":"2.0.0-beta","timestamp":"2018-03-28T16:50:43.076Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.0-beta1","timestamp":"2018-04-12T10:14:12.038Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"npm","version":"^5.8.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.0-beta2","timestamp":"2018-04-17T14:33:17.276Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.0-beta3","timestamp":"2018-05-14T18:17:17.114Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.0-beta4","timestamp":"2018-05-16T21:40:24.280Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.0","timestamp":"2018-05-17T19:56:17.274Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.1","timestamp":"2018-05-27T13:21:42.427Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.2","timestamp":"2018-06-06T12:02:59.979Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.3","timestamp":"2018-06-09T17:13:52.818Z","trustScore":7,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.4","timestamp":"2018-06-18T12:47:37.653Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.5","timestamp":"2018-07-13T21:57:27.941Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.6","timestamp":"2018-07-18T12:03:59.105Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.7","timestamp":"2018-07-20T20:55:04.983Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.8","timestamp":"2018-08-01T13:15:16.341Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.9","timestamp":"2018-09-02T11:28:46.847Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.1.0","timestamp":"2019-02-04T04:42:36.956Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.1.1","timestamp":"2019-02-24T20:47:12.332Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.1.2","timestamp":"2019-03-28T21:49:23.254Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"jsdom","version":"^14.0.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"2.1.3","timestamp":"2019-03-30T17:24:18.819Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.1.4","timestamp":"2019-04-29T20:42:41.585Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.2.0","timestamp":"2019-11-03T23:35:39.661Z","trustScore":19,"dependencies":[]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
