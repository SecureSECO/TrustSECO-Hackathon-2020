On top of that, each segment in the mapping contains offsets rather than absolute indices, which means that you can't look at a segment in isolation – you have to understand the whole sourcemap.\n\nThis package makes the process slightly easier.\n\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nnpm install sourcemap-codec\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nimport { encode, decode } from 'sourcemap-codec';\n\nvar decoded = decode( ';EAEEA,EAAE,EAAC,CAAE;ECQY,UACC' );\n\nassert.deepEqual( decoded, [\n\t// the first line (of the generated code) has no mappings,\n\t// as shown by the starting semi-colon (which separates lines)\n\t[],\n\n\t// the second line contains four (comma-separated) segments\n\t[\n\t\t// segments are encoded as you'd expect:\n\t\t// [ generatedCodeColumn, sourceIndex, sourceCodeLine, sourceCodeColumn, nameIndex ]\n\n\t\t// i.e. the first segment begins at column 2, and maps back to the second column\n\t\t// of the second line (both zero-based) of the 0th source, and uses the 0th\n\t\t// name in the `map.names` array\n\t\t[ 2, 0, 2, 2, 0 ],\n\n\t\t// the remaining segments are 4-length rather than 5-length,\n\t\t// because they don't map a name\n\t\t[ 4, 0, 2, 4 ],\n\t\t[ 6, 0, 2, 5 ],\n\t\t[ 7, 0, 2, 7 ]\n\t],\n\n\t// the final line contains two segments\n\t[\n\t\t[ 2, 1, 10, 19 ],\n\t\t[ 12, 1, 11, 20 ]\n\t]\n]);\n\nvar encoded = encode( decoded );\nassert.equal( encoded, ';EAEEA,EAAE,EAAC,CAAE;ECQY,UACC' );\n```\n\n\n# License\n\nMIT\n","homepage":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris/sourcemap-codec","trustScore":21,"sourceRank":{"basic_info_present":1,"repository_present":1,"readme_present":1,"license_present":1,"versions_present":1,"follows_semver":1,"recent_release":0,"not_brand_new":1,"one_point_oh":1,"dependent_projects":4,"dependent_repositories":5,"stars":2,"contributors":1,"subscribers":1,"all_prereleases":0,"any_outdated_dependencies":0,"is_deprecated":0,"is_unmaintained":0,"is_removed":0,"trustScore":21},"versions":[{"versionNumber":"1.0.0","timestamp":"2015-10-10T04:50:15.664Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"vlq","version":"^0.2.1"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.1.0","timestamp":"2015-10-18T15:09:08.751Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"vlq","version":"^0.2.1"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.2.0","timestamp":"2015-10-23T03:02:07.517Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"vlq","version":"^0.2.1"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.2.1","timestamp":"2015-10-23T03:36:09.346Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"vlq","version":"^0.2.1"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.3.0","timestamp":"2015-12-20T04:55:42.238Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"vlq","version":"^0.2.1"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.3.1","timestamp":"2017-04-13T00:50:21.122Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"vlq","version":"^0.2.1"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.4.0","timestamp":"2018-02-10T15:58:48.751Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"vlq","version":"^1.0.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.4.1","timestamp":"2018-03-13T20:21:21.972Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.4.2","timestamp":"2018-09-20T17:04:24.647Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.4.3","timestamp":"2018-09-20T23:22:06.943Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.4.4","timestamp":"2018-11-21T16:54:00.227Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.4.5","timestamp":"2019-07-03T20:41:55.528Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.4.6","timestamp":"2019-07-04T00:38:42.100Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.4.7","timestamp":"2020-01-03T15:44:33.373Z","trustScore":12,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.4.8","timestamp":"2020-01-16T18:53:46.807Z","trustScore":21,"dependencies":[]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
