Get the great coverage reporting of codecov.io and add a cool coverage button ( like the one above ) to your README.\n\n## Installation:\nAdd the latest version of `codecov.io` to your package.json:\n```\nnpm install codecov.io --save\n```\n\n## Usage:\n\nThis script ( `bin/codecov.io.js` ) can take standard input from any tool that emits the lcov, gcov or standardized json data format and send it to codecov.io to report your code coverage there.\n\nOnce your app is instrumented for coverage, and building, you need to pipe the coverage reports output to `./node_modules/codecov.io/bin/codecov.io.js`.\n\nThis library currently supports the following CI companies: [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/), [Appveyor](https://appveyor.com/), [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/), [Codeship](https://codeship.io/), [Drone](https://drone.io/), [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/), [Shippable](https://shippable.com/), [Semaphore](https://semaphoreapp.com/), [Wercker](https://wercker.com/).\n\n### CI Companies Supported\nJenkins, Travis CI, Codeship, Circle CI, Semaphore, drone.io, AppVeyor, Wercker, Magnum, Shippable, and Gitlab CI. Otherwise fallbacks on `git`.\n\n#### Upload repo tokens\n> Repo tokens are **not** required for public repos tested on Travis, CircleCI or AppVeyor.\n\nRepo tokens are neccessary to distinquish your repository from others. You can find your repo token on your repository page at Codecov. Set this unique uuid to `CODECOV_TOKEN` in your environment variables.\n\n```\nexport CODECOV_TOKEN=\":uuid-repo-token\"\n```\n\n#### [Istanbul](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul)\n\n**With Mocha:**\n\n```sh\nistanbul cover ./node_modules/mocha/bin/_mocha -- -R spec && cat ./coverage/lcov.info | ./node_modules/.bin/codecov\n```\n\n**With Jasmine:**\n\n```sh\nistanbul cover jasmine-node --captureExceptions spec/ && cat ./coverage/lcov.info | ./node_modules/.bin/codecov\n```\n\n**With Tape:**\n\n```sh\nistanbul cover test.js && cat ./coverage/lcov.info | ./node_modules/.bin/codecov\n```\n\n----\n\n## Advanced: Partial Line Coverage\n**Codecov does support partial line coverage**. However, some node projects do not report partial coverage accurate enough.\nYou can decide to upload the partial coverage report by chaning the target upload file to `./coverage/coverage.json`.\nView your report on Codecov, if the reports are not accurate then switch back to the `lcov` provided above.\n\nWe are working on improving this implementation and appreciate your patience.\n\n## Contributing\n\nI generally don't accept pull requests that are untested, or break the build, because I'd like to keep the quality high (this is a coverage tool afterall!).\n\nI also don't care for \"soft-versioning\" or \"optimistic versioning\" (dependencies that have ^, x, > in them, or anything other than numbers and dots).  There have been too many problems with bad semantic versioning in dependencies, and I'd rather have a solid library than a bleeding edge one.\n\n[travis-image]: https://travis-ci.org/cainus/codecov.io.svg?branch=master\n[travis-url]: https://travis-ci.org/cainus/codecov.io\n\n[npm-url]: https://npmjs.org/package/codecov.io\n[npm-image]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/codecov.io.svg\n\n[depstat-url]: https://david-dm.org/cainus/codecov.io\n[depstat-image]: https://img.shields.io/david/cainus/codecov.io/master.svg\n\n[devdepstat-url]: https://david-dm.org/cainus/codecov.io#info=devDependencies\n[devdepstat-image]: https://img.shields.io/david/dev/cainus/codecov.io/master.svg\n","homepage":"https://github.com/cainus/codecov.io","trustScore":20,"sourceRank":{"basic_info_present":1,"repository_present":1,"readme_present":1,"license_present":1,"versions_present":1,"follows_semver":1,"recent_release":0,"not_brand_new":1,"one_point_oh":0,"dependent_projects":6,"dependent_repositories":4,"stars":2,"contributors":1,"subscribers":1,"all_prereleases":0,"any_outdated_dependencies":-1,"is_deprecated":0,"is_unmaintained":0,"is_removed":0,"trustScore":20},"versions":[{"versionNumber":"0.0.0","timestamp":"2014-09-09T06:41:14.956Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"request","version":"2.42.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.1","timestamp":"2014-09-18T05:40:21.854Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"request","version":"2.42.0"},{"packageName":"urlgrey","version":"0.4.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.2","timestamp":"2014-10-07T03:31:34.010Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"request","version":"2.42.0"},{"packageName":"urlgrey","version":"0.4.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.3","timestamp":"2014-10-16T18:53:49.140Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"request","version":"2.42.0"},{"packageName":"urlgrey","version":"0.4.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.4","timestamp":"2014-10-31T17:19:27.814Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"request","version":"2.42.0"},{"packageName":"urlgrey","version":"0.4.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.5","timestamp":"2014-11-03T16:47:44.264Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"request","version":"2.42.0"},{"packageName":"urlgrey","version":"0.4.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.6","timestamp":"2014-11-03T17:02:00.510Z","trustScore":7,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"request","version":"2.42.0"},{"packageName":"urlgrey","version":"0.4.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.7","timestamp":"2014-11-03T17:09:13.365Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"request","version":"2.42.0"},{"packageName":"urlgrey","version":"0.4.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.8","timestamp":"2014-11-04T00:13:18.502Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"request","version":"2.42.0"},{"packageName":"urlgrey","version":"0.4.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.0","timestamp":"2015-04-30T15:46:57.961Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"request","version":"2.42.0"},{"packageName":"urlgrey","version":"0.4.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.1","timestamp":"2015-05-09T13:49:17.793Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"request","version":"2.42.0"},{"packageName":"urlgrey","version":"0.4.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.2","timestamp":"2015-05-14T16:43:16.352Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"request","version":"2.42.0"},{"packageName":"urlgrey","version":"0.4.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.3","timestamp":"2015-06-21T17:46:35.774Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"request","version":"2.42.0"},{"packageName":"urlgrey","version":"0.4.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.4","timestamp":"2015-06-22T01:07:48.317Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"request","version":"2.42.0"},{"packageName":"urlgrey","version":"0.4.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.5","timestamp":"2015-07-03T13:40:36.466Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"request","version":"2.42.0"},{"packageName":"urlgrey","version":"0.4.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.6","timestamp":"2015-08-15T13:17:30.817Z","trustScore":20,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"request","version":"2.42.0"},{"packageName":"urlgrey","version":"0.4.0"}]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
