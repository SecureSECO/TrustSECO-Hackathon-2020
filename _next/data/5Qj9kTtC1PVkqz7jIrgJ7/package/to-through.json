If the returned stream is piped before `nextTick`, the wrapped `readableStream` will not flow until the upstream is flushed. If the stream is not piped before `nextTick`, it is ended and flushed (acting as a proper readable).\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n[downloads-image]: http://img.shields.io/npm/dm/to-through.svg\n[npm-url]: https://npmjs.com/package/to-through\n[npm-image]: http://img.shields.io/npm/v/to-through.svg\n\n[travis-url]: https://travis-ci.org/gulpjs/to-through\n[travis-image]: http://img.shields.io/travis/gulpjs/to-through.svg?label=travis-ci\n\n[appveyor-url]: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/gulpjs/to-through\n[appveyor-image]: https://img.shields.io/appveyor/ci/gulpjs/to-through.svg?label=appveyor\n\n[coveralls-url]: https://coveralls.io/r/gulpjs/to-through\n[coveralls-image]: http://img.shields.io/coveralls/gulpjs/to-through/master.svg\n\n[gitter-url]: https://gitter.im/gulpjs/gulp\n[gitter-image]: https://badges.gitter.im/gulpjs/gulp.png\n","homepage":"https://github.com/gulpjs/to-through#readme","trustScore":15,"sourceRank":{"basic_info_present":1,"repository_present":1,"readme_present":1,"license_present":1,"versions_present":1,"follows_semver":1,"recent_release":0,"not_brand_new":1,"one_point_oh":1,"dependent_projects":2,"dependent_repositories":4,"stars":1,"contributors":0,"subscribers":1,"all_prereleases":0,"any_outdated_dependencies":-1,"is_deprecated":0,"is_unmaintained":0,"is_removed":0,"trustScore":15},"versions":[{"versionNumber":"1.0.0","timestamp":"2017-05-03T00:32:07.541Z","trustScore":6,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"through2","version":"^2.0.3"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.1","timestamp":"2017-05-03T00:48:14.342Z","trustScore":6,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"through2","version":"^2.0.3"}]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.0","timestamp":"2017-05-03T18:13:52.644Z","trustScore":15,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"through2","version":"^2.0.3"}]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
