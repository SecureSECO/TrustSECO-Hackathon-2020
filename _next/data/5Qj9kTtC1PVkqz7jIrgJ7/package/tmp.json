For all API calls, all\nthe parameters are optional. There also exists a promisified version of the\nAPI, see [tmp-promise][5].\n\nTmp uses crypto for determining random file names, or, when using templates,\na six letter random identifier. And just in case that you do not have that much\nentropy left on your system, Tmp will fall back to pseudo random numbers.\n\nYou can set whether you want to remove the temporary file on process exit or\nnot.\n\nIf you do not want to store your temporary directories and files in the\nstandard OS temporary directory, then you are free to override that as well.\n\n## An Important Note on Compatibility\n\nSee the [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md) for more information.\n\n### Version 0.1.0\n\nSince version 0.1.0, all support for node versions < 0.10.0 has been dropped.\n\nMost importantly, any support for earlier versions of node-tmp was also dropped.\n\nIf you still require node versions < 0.10.0, then you must limit your node-tmp\ndependency to versions below 0.1.0.\n\n### Version 0.0.33\n\nSince version 0.0.33, all support for node versions < 0.8 has been dropped.\n\nIf you still require node version 0.8, then you must limit your node-tmp\ndependency to version 0.0.33.\n\nFor node versions < 0.8 you must limit your node-tmp dependency to\nversions < 0.0.33.\n\n## How to install\n\n```bash\nnpm install tmp\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nPlease also check [API docs][4].\n\n### Asynchronous file creation\n\nSimple temporary file creation, the file will be closed and unlinked on process exit.\n\n```javascript\nconst tmp = require('tmp');\n\ntmp.file(function _tempFileCreated(err, path, fd, cleanupCallback) {\n  if (err) throw err;\n\n  console.log('File: ', path);\n  console.log('Filedescriptor: ', fd);\n  \n  // If we don't need the file anymore we could manually call the cleanupCallback\n  // But that is not necessary if we didn't pass the keep option because the library\n  // will clean after itself.\n  cleanupCallback();\n});\n```\n\n### Synchronous file creation\n\nA synchronous version of the above.\n\n```javascript\nconst tmp = require('tmp');\n\nconst tmpobj = tmp.fileSync();\nconsole.log('File: ', tmpobj.name);\nconsole.log('Filedescriptor: ', tmpobj.fd);\n  \n// If we don't need the file anymore we could manually call the removeCallback\n// But that is not necessary if we didn't pass the keep option because the library\n// will clean after itself.\ntmpobj.removeCallback();\n```\n\nNote that this might throw an exception if either the maximum limit of retries\nfor creating a temporary name fails, or, in case that you do not have the permission\nto write to the directory where the temporary file should be created in.\n\n### Asynchronous directory creation\n\nSimple temporary directory creation, it will be removed on process exit.\n\nIf the directory still contains items on process exit, then it won't be removed.\n\n```javascript\nconst tmp = require('tmp');\n\ntmp.dir(function _tempDirCreated(err, path, cleanupCallback) {\n  if (err) throw err;\n\n  console.log('Dir: ', path);\n  \n  // Manual cleanup\n  cleanupCallback();\n});\n```\n\nIf you want to cleanup the directory even when there are entries in it, then\nyou can pass the `unsafeCleanup` option when creating it.\n\n### Synchronous directory creation\n\nA synchronous version of the above.\n\n```javascript\nconst tmp = require('tmp');\n\nconst tmpobj = tmp.dirSync();\nconsole.log('Dir: ', tmpobj.name);\n// Manual cleanup\ntmpobj.removeCallback();\n```\n\nNote that this might throw an exception if either the maximum limit of retries\nfor creating a temporary name fails, or, in case that you do not have the permission\nto write to the directory where the temporary directory should be created in.\n\n### Asynchronous filename generation\n\nIt is possible with this library to generate a unique filename in the specified\ndirectory.\n\n```javascript\nconst tmp = require('tmp');\n\ntmp.tmpName(function _tempNameGenerated(err, path) {\n    if (err) throw err;\n\n    console.log('Created temporary filename: ', path);\n});\n```\n\n### Synchronous filename generation\n\nA synchronous version of the above.\n\n```javascript\nconst tmp = require('tmp');\n\nconst name = tmp.tmpNameSync();\nconsole.log('Created temporary filename: ', name);\n```\n\n## Advanced usage\n\n### Asynchronous file creation\n\nCreates a file with mode `0644`, prefix will be `prefix-` and postfix will be `.txt`.\n\n```javascript\nconst tmp = require('tmp');\n\ntmp.file({ mode: 0o644, prefix: 'prefix-', postfix: '.txt' }, function _tempFileCreated(err, path, fd) {\n  if (err) throw err;\n\n  console.log('File: ', path);\n  console.log('Filedescriptor: ', fd);\n});\n```\n\n### Synchronous file creation\n\nA synchronous version of the above.\n\n```javascript\nconst tmp = require('tmp');\n\nconst tmpobj = tmp.fileSync({ mode: 0o644, prefix: 'prefix-', postfix: '.txt' });\nconsole.log('File: ', tmpobj.name);\nconsole.log('Filedescriptor: ', tmpobj.fd);\n```\n\n### Controlling the Descriptor\n\nAs a side effect of creating a unique file `tmp` gets a file descriptor that is\nreturned to the user as the `fd` parameter.  The descriptor may be used by the\napplication and is closed when the `removeCallback` is invoked.\n\nIn some use cases the application does not need the descriptor, needs to close it\nwithout removing the file, or needs to remove the file without closing the\ndescriptor.  Two options control how the descriptor is managed:\n\n* `discardDescriptor` - if `true` causes `tmp` to close the descriptor after the file\n  is created.  In this case the `fd` parameter is undefined.\n* `detachDescriptor` - if `true` causes `tmp` to return the descriptor in the `fd`\n  parameter, but it is the application's responsibility to close it when it is no\n  longer needed.\n\n```javascript\nconst tmp = require('tmp');\n\ntmp.file({ discardDescriptor: true }, function _tempFileCreated(err, path, fd, cleanupCallback) {\n  if (err) throw err;\n  // fd will be undefined, allowing application to use fs.createReadStream(path)\n  // without holding an unused descriptor open.\n});\n```\n\n```javascript\nconst tmp = require('tmp');\n\ntmp.file({ detachDescriptor: true }, function _tempFileCreated(err, path, fd, cleanupCallback) {\n  if (err) throw err;\n\n  cleanupCallback();\n  // Application can store data through fd here; the space used will automatically\n  // be reclaimed by the operating system when the descriptor is closed or program\n  // terminates.\n});\n```\n\n### Asynchronous directory creation\n\nCreates a directory with mode `0755`, prefix will be `myTmpDir_`.\n\n```javascript\nconst tmp = require('tmp');\n\ntmp.dir({ mode: 0o750, prefix: 'myTmpDir_' }, function _tempDirCreated(err, path) {\n  if (err) throw err;\n\n  console.log('Dir: ', path);\n});\n```\n\n### Synchronous directory creation\n\nAgain, a synchronous version of the above.\n\n```javascript\nconst tmp = require('tmp');\n\nconst tmpobj = tmp.dirSync({ mode: 0750, prefix: 'myTmpDir_' });\nconsole.log('Dir: ', tmpobj.name);\n```\n\n### mkstemp like, asynchronously\n\nCreates a new temporary directory with mode `0700` and filename like `/tmp/tmp-nk2J1u`.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: template no longer accepts a path. Use the dir option instead if you\nrequire tmp to create your temporary filesystem object in a different place than the\ndefault `tmp.tmpdir`.\n\n```javascript\nconst tmp = require('tmp');\n\ntmp.dir({ template: 'tmp-XXXXXX' }, function _tempDirCreated(err, path) {\n  if (err) throw err;\n\n  console.log('Dir: ', path);\n});\n```\n\n### mkstemp like, synchronously\n\nThis will behave similarly to the asynchronous version.\n\n```javascript\nconst tmp = require('tmp');\n\nconst tmpobj = tmp.dirSync({ template: 'tmp-XXXXXX' });\nconsole.log('Dir: ', tmpobj.name);\n```\n\n### Asynchronous filename generation\n\nUsing `tmpName()` you can create temporary file names asynchronously.\nThe function accepts all standard options, e.g. `prefix`, `postfix`, `dir`, and so on.\n\nYou can also leave out the options altogether and just call the function with a callback as first parameter.\n\n```javascript\nconst tmp = require('tmp');\n\nconst options = {};\n\ntmp.tmpName(options, function _tempNameGenerated(err, path) {\n    if (err) throw err;\n\n    console.log('Created temporary filename: ', path);\n});\n```\n\n### Synchronous filename generation\n\nThe `tmpNameSync()` function works similarly to `tmpName()`.\nAgain, you can leave out the options altogether and just invoke the function without any parameters.\n\n```javascript\nconst tmp = require('tmp');\nconst options = {};\nconst tmpname = tmp.tmpNameSync(options);\nconsole.log('Created temporary filename: ', tmpname);\n```\n\n## Graceful cleanup\n\nIf graceful cleanup is set, tmp will remove all controlled temporary objects on process exit, otherwise the\ntemporary objects will remain in place, waiting to be cleaned up on system restart or otherwise scheduled temporary\nobject removal.\n\nTo enforce this, you can call the `setGracefulCleanup()` method:\n\n```javascript\nconst tmp = require('tmp');\n\ntmp.setGracefulCleanup();\n```\n\n## Options\n\nAll options are optional :)\n\n  * `name`: a fixed name that overrides random name generation, the name must be relative and must not contain path segments\n  * `mode`: the file mode to create with, falls back to `0o600` on file creation and `0o700` on directory creation\n  * `prefix`: the optional prefix, defaults to `tmp`\n  * `postfix`: the optional postfix\n  * `template`: [`mkstemp`][3] like filename template, no default, can be either an absolute or a relative path that resolves \n     to a relative path of the system's default temporary directory, must include `XXXXXX` once for random name generation, e.g.\n     'foo/bar/XXXXXX'. Absolute paths are also fine as long as they are relative to os.tmpdir().\n     Any directories along the so specified path must exist, otherwise a ENOENT error will be thrown upon access, \n     as tmp will not check the availability of the path, nor will it establish the requested path for you. \n  * `dir`: the optional temporary directory that must be relative to the system's default temporary directory.\n     absolute paths are fine as long as they point to a location under the system's default temporary directory.\n     Any directories along the so specified path must exist, otherwise a ENOENT error will be thrown upon access, \n     as tmp will not check the availability of the path, nor will it establish the requested path for you.\n  * `tmpdir`: allows you to override the system's root tmp directory\n  * `tries`: how many times should the function try to get a unique filename before giving up, default `3`\n  * `keep`: signals that the temporary file or directory should not be deleted on exit, default is `false`\n    * In order to clean up, you will have to call the provided `cleanupCallback` function manually.\n  * `unsafeCleanup`: recursively removes the created temporary directory, even when it's not empty. default is `false`\n  * `detachDescriptor`: detaches the file descriptor, caller is responsible for closing the file, tmp will no longer try closing the file during garbage collection\n  * `discardDescriptor`: discards the file descriptor (closes file, fd is -1), tmp will no longer try closing the file during garbage collection\n\n[1]:
