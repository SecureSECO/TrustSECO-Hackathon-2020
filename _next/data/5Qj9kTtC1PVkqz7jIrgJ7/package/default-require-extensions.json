This provides extensions functionally identical to the default ones, which you know you can access reliably, no matter what extensions have been installed previously.\n\n\n## Install\n\n```\n$ npm install default-require-extensions\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nconst js = require('default-require-extensions/js');\nconst json = require('default-require-extensions/json');\n\nrequire.extensions['.js'] = js;\nrequire.extensions['.js'] = json;\n```\n\n*Note:* You would never actually do the above. Use these in your custom require extensions instead.\n","homepage":"https://github.com/avajs/default-require-extensions#readme","trustScore":21,"sourceRank":{"basic_info_present":1,"repository_present":1,"readme_present":1,"license_present":1,"versions_present":1,"follows_semver":1,"recent_release":0,"not_brand_new":1,"one_point_oh":1,"dependent_projects":4,"dependent_repositories":5,"stars":1,"contributors":1,"subscribers":2,"all_prereleases":0,"any_outdated_dependencies":0,"is_deprecated":0,"is_unmaintained":0,"is_removed":0,"trustScore":21},"versions":[{"versionNumber":"1.0.0","timestamp":"2016-01-25T21:07:03.201Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"strip-bom","version":"^2.0.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.0","timestamp":"2017-03-26T09:12:31.921Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"strip-bom","version":"^3.0.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"3.0.0","timestamp":"2019-09-09T18:35:43.057Z","trustScore":21,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"strip-bom","version":"^4.0.0"}]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
