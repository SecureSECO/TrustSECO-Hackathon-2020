Walks a directory tree emitting events based on what it finds. Presents a familliar callback/emitter/sync interface. Walk a tree of any depth. This is a performant option any pull requests to make it more so will be taken into consderation.. \n\n## Example\n\n```js\n\nvar walk = require('walkdir');\n\n//async with path callback \n\nwalk('../', function(path, stat) {\n  console.log('found: ', path);\n});\n\n//use async emitter to capture more events\n\nvar emitter = walk('../');\n\nemitter.on('file', function(filename, stat) {\n  console.log('file from emitter: ', filename);\n});\n\n\n//sync with callback\n\nwalk.sync('../', function(path, stat) {\n  console.log('found sync:', path);\n});\n\n//sync just need paths\n\nvar paths = walk.sync('../');\nconsole.log('found paths sync: ', paths);\n\n// async await/promise!\nlet result = await walk.async('../',{return_object:true})\n//result['path'] = {statObject}\n\n```\n\n## install\n\n\tnpm install walkdir\n\n## arguments\n\nwalkdir(path, [options], [callback])\nwalkdir.sync(path, [options], [callback]);\n\n- path\n  - the starting point of your directory walk\n\n- options. supported options are\n  - general\n\n```js\n{\n  /**\n  * follow symlinks. default FALSE\n  */\n  \"follow_symlinks\"?: boolean,\n  /**\n    * only go one level deep. convenience param.\n    */ \n  \"no_recurse\"?: boolean,\n  /**\n    * only travel to max depth. emits an error if hit.\n    */\n  \"max_depth\"?: number,\n  /**\n    * on filesystems where inodes are not unique like windows (or perhaps hardlinks) some files may not be emitted due to inode collision.\n    * turning off this behavior may be required but at the same time may lead to hitting max_depth via link loop.\n    */\n  \"track_inodes\"?: boolean;\n  /**\n    * make this syncronous. the same as calling walkdir.sync\n    */\n  \"sync\"?:boolean,\n  /**\n    * return an object of {path:stat} instead of just the resolved path names\n    */\n  \"return_object\"?: boolean,\n  /**\n    * dont build up an internal list or object of all of the paths. this can be an important optimization for listing HUGE trees.\n    */\n  \"no_return\"?: boolean,\n  /**\n    * filter. filter an array of paths from readdir\n    */\n  \"filter\"?:(directory:string,files:string[])=>string[]|Promise<string[]>,\n  /**\n    *  pass in a custom fs object like gracfeful-fs\n    *  needs stat, lstat, readdir, readlink and sync verisons if you use sync:true\n    */\n  \"fs\"?:any,\n  /*** \n   * default True. if false this will use stat insteqad of lstat and not find links at all.\n   */\n  \"find_links?\":boolean,\n}\n```\n\n  - walkdir.sync/walkdir.async only\n\n\t```js\n\t{\n\t  \"return_object\": false, // if true the sync return will be in {path:stat} format instead of [path,path,...]\n\t  \"no_return\": false, // if true null will be returned and no array or object will be created with found paths. useful for large listings\n\t}\n\t```\n\n- callback\n  - this is bound to the path event of the emitter. its optional in all cases.\n\n\t```js\n\tcallback(path, stat)\n\t```\n\n## events\n\nnon error type events are emitted with (path,stat). stat is an instanceof fs.Stats\n\n### path\nfired for everything\n\n### file\nfired only for regular files\n\n### directory\nfired only for directories\n\n### link\nfired when a symbolic link is found\n\n### end\nfired when the entire tree has been read and emitted.\n\n### socket\nfired when a socket descriptor is found\n\n### fifo\nfired when a fifo is found\n\n### characterdevice\nfired when a character device is found\n\n### blockdevice\nfired when a block device is found\n\n### targetdirectory\nfired for the stat of the path you provided as the first argument. is is only fired if it is a directory.\n\n### empty\nfired for empty directory\n\n## error events\nerror type events are emitted with (path,error). error being the error object returned from an fs call or other opperation.\n\n### error\nif the target path cannot be read an error event is emitted. this is the only failure case.\n\n### fail\nwhen stat or read fails on a path somewhere in the walk and it is not your target path you get a fail event instead of error.\nThis is handy if you want to find places you dont have access too.\n\n## notes\nthe async emitter returned supports 3 methods\n\n###end\n  stop a walk in progress\n\n###pause\n  pause the walk. no more events will be emitted until resume\n\n###resume\n  resume the walk\n\n### ignore(path or array of paths)\n  will not traverse these directories. may be called in the path event handler to ignore dynamically. \n  ```js\n  var walk = require('walkdir');\n  var p = require('path');\n  walk('/', function(path, stat) {\n    // ignore all .git directories.\n    if (p.basename(path) === '.git') {\n      this.ignore(path)\n    }\n  })\n  ```\n\n### cancel a walk in progress\n  ```js\n  //cancel a walk in progress within callback.\n\n  var walk = require('walkdir');\n  walk('../', function(path, stat) {\n    this.end();\n  });\n\n  //cancel a walk in progress with emitter handle\n  var walk = require('walkdir');\n  var emitter = walk('../');\n\n  doSomethingAsync(function() {\n    emitter.end();\n  })\n  ```\n\n## thanks\nthanks to substack. the interface for this module is based off of node-findit\n\n## contributing\nsee `CONTRIBUTING.md` for guidelines. this is an open opensource project.\n\n","homepage":"http://github.com/soldair/node-walkdir","trustScore":19,"sourceRank":{"basic_info_present":1,"repository_present":1,"readme_present":1,"license_present":1,"versions_present":1,"follows_semver":1,"recent_release":0,"not_brand_new":1,"one_point_oh":0,"dependent_projects":4,"dependent_repositories":4,"stars":2,"contributors":1,"subscribers":1,"all_prereleases":0,"any_outdated_dependencies":0,"is_deprecated":0,"is_unmaintained":0,"is_removed":0,"trustScore":19},"versions":[{"versionNumber":"0.0.1","timestamp":"2012-03-25T21:37:32.996Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.2","timestamp":"2012-05-31T16:19:48.222Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.3","timestamp":"2012-06-12T00:38:38.260Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.4","timestamp":"2012-06-17T15:10:43.952Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.5","timestamp":"2012-09-08T21:51:07.010Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.7","timestamp":"2013-04-21T15:12:18.829Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.8","timestamp":"2015-04-07T15:28:15.501Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.9","timestamp":"2015-04-27T04:00:43.153Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.10","timestamp":"2015-06-25T23:17:33.715Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.11","timestamp":"2015-11-13T13:22:10.862Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.12","timestamp":"2017-08-29T14:47:26.704Z","trustScore":7,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.0","timestamp":"2019-02-05T02:13:14.637Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.1","timestamp":"2019-02-05T18:15:20.064Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.2.0","timestamp":"2019-02-06T18:08:55.380Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.3.0","timestamp":"2019-02-07T23:00:35.405Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.3.1","timestamp":"2019-02-07T23:10:46.024Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.3.2","timestamp":"2019-02-07T23:15:28.132Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.4.0","timestamp":"2019-05-14T18:15:08.758Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.4.1","timestamp":"2019-07-18T15:15:19.015Z","trustScore":19,"dependencies":[]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
