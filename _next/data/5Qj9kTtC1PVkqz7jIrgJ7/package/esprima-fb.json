We then take the most significant digit.\n\n**Example:** 4001.3001.0000-dev-harmony-fb aligns with 1.1.0-dev-harmony (aka 001.001.000-dev-harmony) in upstream, with our own changes on top.\n\nEsprima-FB serves as a **building block** for JSX language tools and transpiler implementations (such as [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) or [JSXDOM](https://github.com/vjeux/jsxdom)).\n\nEsprima-FB runs on many popular web browsers, as well as other ECMAScript platforms such as\n[Rhino](http://www.mozilla.org/rhino) and [Node.js](https://npmjs.org/package/esprima).\n\nFor more information on original Esprima, check the web site [esprima.org](http://esprima.org).\n","homepage":"https://github.com/facebook/esprima/tree/fb-harmony","trustScore":16,"sourceRank":{"basic_info_present":1,"repository_present":1,"readme_present":1,"license_present":1,"versions_present":1,"follows_semver":1,"recent_release":0,"not_brand_new":1,"one_point_oh":1,"dependent_projects":4,"dependent_repositories":4,"stars":2,"contributors":1,"subscribers":1,"all_prereleases":-2,"any_outdated_dependencies":0,"is_deprecated":0,"is_unmaintained":0,"is_removed":0,"trustScore":16},"versions":[{"versionNumber":"1001.1001.1000-dev-harmony-fb","timestamp":"2013-08-16T21:57:17.916Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1001.1001.1001-dev-harmony-fb","timestamp":"2013-10-16T01:32:47.010Z","trustScore":7,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1001.1001.2000-dev-harmony-fb","timestamp":"2013-10-16T01:45:03.233Z","trustScore":7,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2001.1001.2000-dev-harmony-fb","timestamp":"2013-11-06T19:54:21.228Z","trustScore":7,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2001.1001.0-dev-harmony-fb","timestamp":"2013-11-06T19:55:09.983Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"3001.1.0-dev-harmony-fb","timestamp":"2014-02-15T20:08:37.986Z","trustScore":7,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"4001.1.0-dev-harmony-fb","timestamp":"2014-05-22T23:00:52.124Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"4001.1001.0-dev-harmony-fb","timestamp":"2014-06-26T21:42:45.135Z","trustScore":6,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"4001.3001.0-dev-harmony-fb","timestamp":"2014-07-10T22:41:48.696Z","trustScore":7,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"5001.1.0-dev-harmony-fb","timestamp":"2014-08-15T16:01:52.033Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"6001.1.0-dev-harmony-fb","timestamp":"2014-09-05T18:51:52.100Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"6001.1001.0-dev-harmony-fb","timestamp":"2014-09-11T02:24:47.733Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"7001.1.0-dev-harmony-fb","timestamp":"2014-10-08T14:23:29.121Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"8001.1.0-dev-harmony-fb","timestamp":"2014-11-15T00:52:28.762Z","trustScore":7,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"8001.1001.0-dev-harmony-fb","timestamp":"2014-11-18T06:15:52.292Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"8001.2001.0-dev-harmony-fb","timestamp":"2014-12-19T23:32:50.054Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"9001.1.0-dev-harmony-fb","timestamp":"2015-01-13T18:05:18.821Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"10001.1.0-dev-harmony-fb","timestamp":"2015-01-14T17:59:21.871Z","trustScore":7,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"11001.1.0-dev-harmony-fb","timestamp":"2015-02-10T03:23:48.039Z","trustScore":7,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"12001.1.0-dev-harmony-fb","timestamp":"2015-02-10T21:56:14.918Z","trustScore":7,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"13001.1.0-dev-harmony-fb","timestamp":"2015-03-01T19:18:07.286Z","trustScore":7,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"13001.1001.0-dev-harmony-fb","timestamp":"2015-03-06T18:31:15.414Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"14001.1.0-dev-harmony-fb","timestamp":"2015-04-02T21:44:11.870Z","trustScore":7,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"15001.1.0-dev-harmony-fb","timestamp":"2015-04-22T21:48:55.002Z","trustScore":7,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"15001.1001.0-dev-harmony-fb","timestamp":"2015-07-31T22:47:13.272Z","trustScore":16,"dependencies":[]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
