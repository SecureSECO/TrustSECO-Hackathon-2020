By default, return values are rounded. To get the unrounded (raw) results, simply tack on `.raw` to the function.\n\nAll 'from' functions have a hidden property called `.channels` that indicates the number of channels the function expects (not including alpha).\n\n```js\nvar convert = require('color-convert');\n\n// Hex to LAB\nconvert.hex.lab('DEADBF');         // [ 76, 21, -2 ]\nconvert.hex.lab.raw('DEADBF');     // [ 75.56213190997677, 20.653827952644754, -2.290532499330533 ]\n\n// RGB to CMYK\nconvert.rgb.cmyk(167, 255, 4);     // [ 35, 0, 98, 0 ]\nconvert.rgb.cmyk.raw(167, 255, 4); // [ 34.509803921568626, 0, 98.43137254901961, 0 ]\n```\n\n### Arrays\nAll functions that accept multiple arguments also support passing an array.\n\nNote that this does **not** apply to functions that convert from a color that only requires one value (e.g. `keyword`, `ansi256`, `hex`, etc.)\n\n```js\nvar convert = require('color-convert');\n\nconvert.rgb.hex(123, 45, 67);      // '7B2D43'\nconvert.rgb.hex([123, 45, 67]);    // '7B2D43'\n```\n\n## Routing\n\nConversions that don't have an _explicitly_ defined conversion (in [conversions.js](conversions.js)), but can be converted by means of sub-conversions (e.g. XYZ -> **RGB** -> CMYK), are automatically routed together. This allows just about any color model supported by `color-convert` to be converted to any other model, so long as a sub-conversion path exists. This is also true for conversions requiring more than one step in between (e.g. LCH -> **LAB** -> **XYZ** -> **RGB** -> Hex).\n\nKeep in mind that extensive conversions _may_ result in a loss of precision, and exist only to be complete. For a list of \"direct\" (single-step) conversions, see [conversions.js](conversions.js).\n\n# Contribute\n\nIf there is a new model you would like to support, or want to add a direct conversion between two existing models, please send us a pull request.\n\n# License\nCopyright &copy; 2011-2016, Heather Arthur and Josh Junon.
