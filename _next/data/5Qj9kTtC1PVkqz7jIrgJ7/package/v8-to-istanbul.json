'OSXy' /* c8 ignore next */ : 'Windowsy' \n```\n\n## Testing\n\nTo execute tests, simply run:\n\n```bash\nnpm test\n```\n","homepage":"https://github.com/istanbuljs/v8-to-istanbul#readme","trustScore":19,"sourceRank":{"basic_info_present":1,"repository_present":1,"readme_present":1,"license_present":1,"versions_present":1,"follows_semver":1,"recent_release":1,"not_brand_new":1,"one_point_oh":1,"dependent_projects":4,"dependent_repositories":2,"stars":2,"contributors":1,"subscribers":1,"all_prereleases":0,"any_outdated_dependencies":0,"is_deprecated":0,"is_unmaintained":0,"is_removed":0,"trustScore":19},"versions":[{"versionNumber":"1.0.0","timestamp":"2017-11-25T04:35:19.478Z","trustScore":7,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.1.0","timestamp":"2017-12-01T07:23:56.340Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.2.0","timestamp":"2017-12-05T05:53:13.187Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.2.1","timestamp":"2018-09-12T22:50:13.381Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.0","timestamp":"2018-12-21T00:53:13.743Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.1","timestamp":"2019-01-20T20:29:05.022Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.2","timestamp":"2019-01-20T22:04:44.859Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.3","timestamp":"2019-04-07T01:31:05.470Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.4","timestamp":"2019-04-07T02:15:15.448Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.5","timestamp":"2019-04-18T19:44:38.592Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.1.0","timestamp":"2019-04-21T01:03:04.305Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"3.0.0","timestamp":"2019-04-29T06:55:41.991Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"convert-source-map","version":"^1.6.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"3.0.1","timestamp":"2019-05-01T06:44:54.185Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"convert-source-map","version":"^1.6.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"3.1.0","timestamp":"2019-05-02T05:10:31.148Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"convert-source-map","version":"^1.6.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"3.1.1","timestamp":"2019-05-02T05:35:29.990Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"convert-source-map","version":"^1.6.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"3.1.2","timestamp":"2019-05-02T06:23:08.092Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"convert-source-map","version":"^1.6.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"3.1.3","timestamp":"2019-05-11T00:22:35.880Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"convert-source-map","version":"^1.6.0"},{"packageName":"source-map","version":"^0.7.3"}]},{"versionNumber":"3.2.0","timestamp":"2019-06-23T20:07:42.254Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"@types/istanbul-lib-coverage","version":"^2.0.1"},{"packageName":"convert-source-map","version":"^1.6.0"},{"packageName":"source-map","version":"^0.7.3"}]},{"versionNumber":"3.2.1","timestamp":"2019-06-23T21:12:38.182Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"@types/istanbul-lib-coverage","version":"^2.0.1"},{"packageName":"convert-source-map","version":"^1.6.0"},{"packageName":"source-map","version":"^0.7.3"}]},{"versionNumber":"3.2.2","timestamp":"2019-06-24T01:45:05.267Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"@types/istanbul-lib-coverage","version":"^2.0.1"},{"packageName":"convert-source-map","version":"^1.6.0"},{"packageName":"source-map","version":"^0.7.3"}]},{"versionNumber":"3.2.3","timestamp":"2019-06-24T02:03:27.631Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"@types/istanbul-lib-coverage","version":"^2.0.1"},{"packageName":"convert-source-map","version":"^1.6.0"},{"packageName":"source-map","version":"^0.7.3"}]},{"versionNumber":"3.2.4","timestamp":"2019-10-06T04:36:27.453Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"@types/istanbul-lib-coverage","version":"^2.0.1"},{"packageName":"convert-source-map","version":"^1.6.0"},{"packageName":"source-map","version":"^0.7.3"}]},{"versionNumber":"3.2.5","timestamp":"2019-10-07T17:52:08.200Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"@types/istanbul-lib-coverage","version":"^2.0.1"},{"packageName":"convert-source-map","version":"^1.6.0"},{"packageName":"source-map","version":"^0.7.3"}]},{"versionNumber":"3.2.6","timestamp":"2019-10-24T00:16:23.356Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"@types/istanbul-lib-coverage","version":"^2.0.1"},{"packageName":"convert-source-map","version":"^1.6.0"},{"packageName":"source-map","version":"^0.7.3"}]},{"versionNumber":"4.0.0","timestamp":"2019-11-23T01:29:04.141Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"@types/istanbul-lib-coverage","version":"^2.0.1"},{"packageName":"convert-source-map","version":"^1.6.0"},{"packageName":"source-map","version":"^0.7.3"}]},{"versionNumber":"4.0.1","timestamp":"2019-12-16T15:52:42.208Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"@types/istanbul-lib-coverage","version":"^2.0.1"},{"packageName":"convert-source-map","version":"^1.6.0"},{"packageName":"source-map","version":"^0.7.3"}]},{"versionNumber":"4.1.0","timestamp
