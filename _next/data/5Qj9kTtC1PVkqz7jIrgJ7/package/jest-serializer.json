By default, the `v8` implementations are used, but if not present, it defaults to `JSON` implementation. Both serializers have the advantage of being able to serialize `Map`, `Set`, `undefined`, `NaN`, etc, although the JSON one does it through a replacer/reviver.\n\n## Install\n\n```sh\n$ yarn add jest-serializer\n```\n\n## API\n\nThree kinds of API groups are exposed:\n\n### In-memory serialization: `serialize` and `deserialize`\n\nThis set of functions take or return a `Buffer`. All the process happens in memory. This is useful when willing to transfer over HTTP, TCP or via UNIX pipes.\n\n```javascript\nimport {deserialize, serialize} from 'jest-serializer';\n\nconst myObject = {\n  foo: 'bar',\n  baz: [0, true, '2', [], {}],\n};\n\nconst buffer = serialize(myObject);\nconst myCopyObject = deserialize(buffer);\n```\n\n### Synchronous persistent filesystem: `readFileSync` and `writeFileSync`\n\nThis set of functions allow to send to disk a serialization result and retrieve it back, in a synchronous way. It mimics the `fs` API so it looks familiar.\n\n```javascript\nimport {readFileSync, writeFileSync} from 'jest-serializer';\n\nconst myObject = {\n  foo: 'bar',\n  baz: [0, true, '2', [], {}],\n};\n\nconst myFile = '/tmp/obj';\n\nwriteFileSync(myFile, myObject);\nconst myCopyObject = readFileSync(myFile);\n```\n","homepage":"https://github.com/facebook/jest#readme","trustScore":26,"sourceRank":{"basic_info_present":1,"repository_present":1,"readme_present":1,"license_present":1,"versions_present":1,"follows_semver":1,"recent_release":1,"not_brand_new":1,"one_point_oh":1,"dependent_projects":4,"dependent_repositories":5,"stars":5,"contributors":2,"subscribers":1,"all_prereleases":0,"any_outdated_dependencies":0,"is_deprecated":0,"is_unmaintained":0,"is_removed":0,"trustScore":26},"versions":[{"versionNumber":"22.4.0","timestamp":"2018-02-20T12:03:31.268Z","trustScore":12,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"22.4.3","timestamp":"2018-03-21T16:08:08.386Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"23.0.0-alpha.7","timestamp":"2018-04-17T18:55:10.917Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"23.0.0-beta.0","timestamp":"2018-04-20T10:10:36.896Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"23.0.0-beta.1","timestamp":"2018-04-21T15:44:23.610Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"23.0.0-beta.2","timestamp":"2018-04-26T21:17:36.400Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"23.0.0-alpha.3r","timestamp":"2018-04-30T13:10:11.923Z","trustScore":12,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"23.0.0-beta.3r","timestamp":"2018-04-30T13:14:53.078Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"23.0.0-charlie.0","timestamp":"2018-05-02T10:56:16.770Z","trustScore":12,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"23.0.0-charlie.1","timestamp":"2018-05-03T12:10:14.319Z","trustScore":12,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"23.0.0-charlie.2","timestamp":"2018-05-15T09:51:25.446Z","trustScore":12,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"23.0.0-charlie.3","timestamp":"2018-05-22T14:58:57.510Z","trustScore":12,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"23.0.0-charlie.4","timestamp":"2018-05-23T10:42:16.459Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"23.0.0","timestamp":"2018-05-24T17:26:22.735Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"23.0.1","timestamp":"2018-05-27T15:30:50.111Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"24.0.0-alpha.0","timestamp":"2018-10-19T12:12:40.370Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"24.0.0-alpha.1","timestamp":"2018-10-22T15:35:44.233Z","trustScore":12,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"24.0.0-alpha.2","timestamp":"2018-10-25T10:50:57.304Z","trustScore":12,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"24.0.0-alpha.4","timestamp":"2018-10-26T16:33:10.800Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"24.0.0-alpha.5","timestamp":"2018-11-09T13:12:41.450Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"24.0.0-alpha.6","timestamp":"2018-11-09T17:49:38.079Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"24.0.0-alpha.7","timestamp":"2018-12-11T16:07:49.579Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"24.0.0-alpha.9","timestamp":"2018-12-19T14:25:26.320Z","trustScore":12,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"24.0.0-alpha.10","timestamp":"2019-01-09T17:03:56.255Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"24.0.0-alpha.11","timestamp":"2019-01-10T18:34:34.788Z","trustScore":13,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"24.0.0-alpha.12","timestamp":"2019-01-11T15:00:39.837Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"24.0.0-alpha.13","timestamp":"2019-01-23T15:15:27.729Z","trustScore":12,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"24.0.0-alpha.15","timestamp":"2019-01-24T17:52:31.004Z","trustScore":13,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"24.0.0-alpha.16","timestamp":"2019-01-25T13:41:59.212Z","trustScore":14,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"24.0.0","timestamp":"2019-01-25T15:04:54.669Z","trustScore":13,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"24.2.0-alpha.0","timestamp":"2019-03-05T14:46:22.110Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"24.3.0","timestamp":"2019-03-07T12:59:19.260Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"24.4.0","timestamp":"2019-03-11T14:57:48.711Z","trustScore":12,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"24.9.0","timestamp":"2019-08-16T05:55:46.480Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"25.0.0","timestamp":"2019-08-22T03:23:44.144Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"25.1.0","timestamp":"2020-01-22T00:59:44.561Z","trustScore":15,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"25.2.0-alpha.86","timestamp":"2020-03-25T17:16:11.577Z","trustScore":21,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"25.2.0","timestamp":"2020-03-25T17:57:55.003Z","trustScore":20,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"25.2.1-alpha.1","timestamp":"2020-03-26T07:54:13.589Z","trustScore":23,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"25.2.1-alpha.2","timestamp":"2020-03-26T08:10:21.390Z","trustScore":18,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"25.2.1","timestamp":"2020-03-26T09:01:04.272Z","trustScore":23,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"25.2.6","timestamp":"2020-04-02T10:29:08.149Z","trustScore":23,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"25.5.0","timestamp
