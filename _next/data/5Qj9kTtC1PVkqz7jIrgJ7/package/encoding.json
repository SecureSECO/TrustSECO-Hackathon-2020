Somehow it also ended up as a dependency for a bunch of other project, none of these actually using _node-iconv_. The loading mechanics caused issues for front-end projects and Nodemailer/malparser had moved on, so _node-iconv_ was removed.\n\n## Install\n\nInstall through npm\n\n    npm install encoding\n\n## Usage\n\nRequire the module\n\n    var encoding = require(\"encoding\");\n\nConvert with encoding.convert()\n\n    var resultBuffer = encoding.convert(text, toCharset, fromCharset);\n\nWhere\n\n-   **text** is either a Buffer or a String to be converted\n-   **toCharset** is the characterset to convert the string\n-   **fromCharset** (_optional_, defaults to UTF-8) is the source charset\n\nOutput of the conversion is always a Buffer object.\n\nExample\n\n    var result = encoding.convert(\"ÕÄÖÜ\", \"Latin_1\");\n    console.log(result); //<Buffer d5 c4 d6 dc>\n\n## License\n\n**MIT**\n","homepage":"https://github.com/andris9/encoding#readme","trustScore":22,"sourceRank":{"basic_info_present":1,"repository_present":1,"readme_present":1,"license_present":1,"versions_present":1,"follows_semver":1,"recent_release":1,"not_brand_new":1,"one_point_oh":0,"dependent_projects":4,"dependent_repositories":5,"stars":2,"contributors":1,"subscribers":2,"all_prereleases":0,"any_outdated_dependencies":0,"is_deprecated":0,"is_unmaintained":0,"is_removed":0,"trustScore":22},"versions":[{"versionNumber":"0.1.1","timestamp":"2012-08-16T08:36:05.770Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"iconv-lite","version":"*"},{"packageName":"iconv","version":"*"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.2","timestamp":"2012-08-16T08:48:07.540Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"iconv-lite","version":"*"},{"packageName":"iconv","version":"*"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.3","timestamp":"2012-09-04T09:56:33.049Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"iconv-lite","version":"*"},{"packageName":"iconv","version":"*"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.4","timestamp":"2012-09-14T13:13:45.852Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"iconv-lite","version":"*"},{"packageName":"iconv","version":"*"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.5","timestamp":"2012-11-07T09:24:38.001Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"iconv-lite","version":"*"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.6","timestamp":"2013-03-23T06:20:47.925Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"iconv-lite","version":"0.2.7"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.7","timestamp":"2013-09-03T10:45:22.834Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"iconv-lite","version":"~0.2.11"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.8","timestamp":"2014-06-17T12:13:45.482Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"iconv-lite","version":"~0.4.3"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.9","timestamp":"2014-10-13T06:44:03.588Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"iconv-lite","version":"^0.4.4"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.10","timestamp":"2014-10-16T12:37:21.638Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"iconv-lite","version":"~0.4.4"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.11","timestamp":"2014-11-08T19:41:18.146Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"iconv-lite","version":"~0.4.4"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.12","timestamp":"2015-12-23T09:06:30.764Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"iconv-lite","version":"~0.4.13"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.13","timestamp":"2020-07-10T07:02:11.638Z","trustScore":22,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"iconv-lite","version":"^0.6.2"}]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
