Derived from gruntjs's v0.4.1 `file.expand`","repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/anodynos/node-glob-expand.git"},"readme":"# glob-expand v0.2.1\n\nA (sync) glob / minimatch / RegExp call using [gruntjs](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt)'s `file.expand`.\n\nIt has only a minimum of dependencies: `glob` (version 4.x that has negation patterns) & `lodash`.\n\nIts almost a copy/paste of 2 functions from Gruntjs's v0.4.1 [grunt/file.js](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/blob/master/lib/grunt/file.js)\n\nAdditionally you can use [minimatch](http://github.com/isaacs/minimatch/) `String`s or `RegExp`s, either as an Array or as arguments.\n*\n\n## Install:\n\n`npm install glob-expand`\n\n## Examples:\n```coffeescript\n\texpand = require 'glob-expand'\n\n\t# may the original node-glob be with you (should you need it):\n\tglob = expand.glob\n\n\texpand {filter: 'isFile', cwd: '../'}, ['**/*.*', '!exclude/these/**/*.*']\n\t# returns all files in cwd ['file1', 'file2',...] but excluding\n\t# those under directory 'exclude/these'\n\n\t# These are the same\n\texpand {cwd: '../..'}, ['**/*.*', '!node_modules/**/*.*']\n\texpand {cwd: '../..'}, '**/*.*', '!node_modules/**/*.*'\n\n\t# These are the same too:\n\texpand {}, ['**/*.*', '!**/*.js']\n\texpand {}, '**/*.*', '!**/*.js'\n\texpand ['**/*.*', '!**/*.js']\n\texpand '**/*.*', '!**/*.js'\n\n\t# Using Regular Expressions:\n\texpand '**/*.js', /.*\\.(coffee\\.md|litcoffee|coffee)$/i, '!DRAFT*.*'\n\t# -> returns all `.js`, `.coffee`, `.coffee.md` & `.litcoffee` files,\n\t#    excluding those starting with 'DRAFT'\n\n```\n\nSee [gruntjs files configuration](http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks#files)\nand [node-glob](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob) for more options.\n\nSorry no tests, I assumed gruntjs's tests are sufficient ;-)\n\n# License\n\nThe MIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2013-2016 Angelos Pikoulas (agelos.pikoulas@gmail.com)\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person\nobtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation\nfiles (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without\nrestriction, including without limitation the rights to use,\ncopy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the\nSoftware is furnished to do so, subject to the following\nconditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES\nOF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\nNONINFRINGEMENT.
