(So you can show `****` instead of the\n  password, for example.)\n\n* `prompt` If you are using a replacement char, and also using a\n  prompt with a readline stream (as for a `Password: *****` input),\n  then specify what the prompt is so that backspace will work\n  properly.  Otherwise, pressing backspace will overwrite the prompt\n  with the replacement character, which is weird.\n\n## ms.mute()\n\nSet `muted` to `true`.  Turns `.write()` into a no-op.\n\n## ms.unmute()\n\nSet `muted` to `false`\n\n## ms.isTTY\n\nTrue if the pipe destination is a TTY, or if the incoming pipe source is\na TTY.\n\n## Other stream methods...\n\nThe other standard readable and writable stream methods are all\navailable.  The MuteStream object acts as a facade to its pipe source\nand destination.\n","homepage":"https://github.com/isaacs/mute-stream#readme","trustScore":22,"sourceRank":{"basic_info_present":1,"repository_present":1,"readme_present":1,"license_present":1,"versions_present":1,"follows_semver":1,"recent_release":0,"not_brand_new":1,"one_point_oh":0,"dependent_projects":4,"dependent_repositories":6,"stars":2,"contributors":1,"subscribers":2,"all_prereleases":0,"any_outdated_dependencies":0,"is_deprecated":0,"is_unmaintained":0,"is_removed":0,"trustScore":22},"versions":[{"versionNumber":"0.0.1","timestamp":"2012-07-24T01:27:22.992Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.2","timestamp":"2012-07-24T22:21:44.924Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.3","timestamp":"2012-08-15T05:16:15.116Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.4","timestamp":"2013-07-15T01:15:17.730Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.5","timestamp":"2015-05-20T07:11:56.592Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.6","timestamp":"2016-02-13T06:01:25.846Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.7","timestamp":"2017-01-03T22:47:53.781Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.8","timestamp":"2018-12-28T05:23:49.143Z","trustScore":22,"dependencies":[]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
