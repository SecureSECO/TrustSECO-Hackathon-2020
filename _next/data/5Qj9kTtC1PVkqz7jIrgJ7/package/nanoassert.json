In Javascript runtimes that use v8, you will get a nicer\nstack trace with this error.\nIf you want friendlier messages you can use template strings to show the\nassertion made like in the example above.\n\n## Why\n\nI like to write public facing code very defensively, but have reservations about\nthe size incurred by the `assert` module. I only use the top-level `assert`\nmethod anyway.\n\n## `nanoassert@^1.1.0`\n\nDocs for the previous version, which is used by many modules on npm, can be\n[found here](https://github.com/emilbayes/nanoassert/tree/v1.1.0)\n\n## Install\n\n```sh\nnpm install nanoassert\n```\n\n## License\n\n[ISC](LICENSE)\n","homepage":"https://github.com/emilbayes/nanoassert#readme","trustScore":17,"sourceRank":{"basic_info_present":1,"repository_present":1,"readme_present":1,"license_present":1,"versions_present":1,"follows_semver":1,"recent_release":0,"not_brand_new":1,"one_point_oh":1,"dependent_projects":4,"dependent_repositories":3,"stars":1,"contributors":0,"subscribers":1,"all_prereleases":0,"any_outdated_dependencies":0,"is_deprecated":0,"is_unmaintained":0,"is_removed":0,"trustScore":17},"versions":[{"versionNumber":"1.0.0","timestamp":"2017-06-08T17:55:55.470Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.1.0","timestamp":"2017-07-24T16:28:14.381Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.0","timestamp":"2019-01-21T12:40:16.742Z","trustScore":17,"dependencies":[]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
