It effectively pauses the current thread.  It may be woken early if an interupt is fired, so it should work pretty well for busy waiting scenarios where you want to check something every few hunderd milliseconds.\n\n[![Linux and Mac Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/ForbesLindesay/thread-sleep/master.svg?label=Linux%20%26%20Mac%20Build)](https://travis-ci.org/ForbesLindesay/thread-sleep)\n[![Windows Build Status](https://img.shields.io/appveyor/ci/ForbesLindesay/thread-sleep/master.svg?label=Windows%20Build)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ForbesLindesay/thread-sleep)\n[![Dependency Status](https://img.shields.io/david/ForbesLindesay/thread-sleep.svg)](https://david-dm.org/ForbesLindesay/thread-sleep)\n[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/thread-sleep.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/thread-sleep)\n\n## Installation\n\n    npm install thread-sleep\n\nThis module uses node-pre-gyp so it should install even without a compiler in most environments.  If you run into any problems, please open an issue with the full npm log, and a description of what operating system you use.\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nvar sleep = require('thread-sleep');\n\nvar start = Date.now();\nvar res = sleep(1000);\nvar end = Date.now();\n// res is the actual time that we slept for\nconsole.log(res + ' ~= ' + (end - start) + ' ~= 1000');\n// tested on osx and resulted in => 1005 ~= 1010 ~= 1000\n```\n\n## License\n\n  MIT\n","homepage":"https://github.com/ForbesLindesay/thread-sleep#readme","trustScore":15,"sourceRank":{"basic_info_present":1,"repository_present":1,"readme_present":1,"license_present":1,"versions_present":1,"follows_semver":1,"recent_release":0,"not_brand_new":1,"one_point_oh":1,"dependent_projects":4,"dependent_repositories":2,"stars":1,"contributors":0,"subscribers":0,"all_prereleases":0,"any_outdated_dependencies":0,"is_deprecated":0,"is_unmaintained":0,"is_removed":0,"trustScore":15},"versions":[{"versionNumber":"0.0.0","timestamp":"2015-01-15T05:40:09.131Z","trustScore":7,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"nan","version":"^1.5.0"},{"packageName":"node-pre-gyp","version":"^0.6.1"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.1","timestamp":"2015-02-05T09:40:36.897Z","trustScore":7,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"nan","version":"^1.5.0"},{"packageName":"node-pre-gyp","version":"^0.6.1"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.2","timestamp":"2015-02-05T10:16:56.483Z","trustScore":7,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"nan","version":"^1.5.0"},{"packageName":"node-pre-gyp","version":"^0.6.1"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.3","timestamp":"2015-02-05T12:39:09.307Z","trustScore":6,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"nan","version":"<2.0.0 >1.6.2 || 1.5.0"},{"packageName":"node-pre-gyp","version":"^0.6.2"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.4","timestamp":"2015-02-05T13:12:23.017Z","trustScore":7,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"nan","version":"<2.0.0 >1.6.2 || 1.5.0"},{"packageName":"node-pre-gyp","version":"^0.6.2"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.5","timestamp":"2015-02-05T15:17:59.844Z","trustScore":7,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"nan","version":"<2.0.0 >1.6.2 || 1.5.0"},{"packageName":"node-pre-gyp","version":"^0.6.2"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.0","timestamp":"2015-02-05T15:50:31.337Z","trustScore":6,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"nan","version":"<2.0.0 >1.6.2 || 1.5.0"},{"packageName":"node-pre-gyp","version":"^0.6.2"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.1","timestamp":"2015-02-06T09:56:17.461Z","trustScore":7,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"nan","version":"<2.0.0 >1.6.2 || 1.5.0"},{"packageName":"node-pre-gyp","version":"^0.6.2"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.2","timestamp":"2015-02-06T12:31:31.189Z","trustScore":7,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"nan","version":"<2.0.0 >1.6.2 || 1.5.0"},{"packageName":"node-pre-gyp","version":"^0.6.2"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.3","timestamp":"2015-02-11T09:44:44.955Z","trustScore":7,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"nan","version":"<2.0.0 >1.6.2 || 1.5.0"},{"packageName":"node-pre-gyp","version":"^0.6.2"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.4","timestamp":"2015-09-09T17:08:55.383Z","trustScore":7,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"nan","version":"^2.0.9"},{"packageName":"node-pre-gyp","version":"^0.6.2"}]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.0","timestamp":"2016-12-29T18:46:14.289Z","trustScore":6,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.1.0","timestamp":"2018-06-01T14:04:24.637Z","trustScore":7,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.2.0","timestamp":"2019-03-17T15:13:03.070Z","trustScore":15,"dependencies":[]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
