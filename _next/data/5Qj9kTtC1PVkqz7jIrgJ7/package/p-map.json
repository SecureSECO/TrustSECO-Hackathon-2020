The fulfilled value is an `Array` of the fulfilled values returned from `mapper` in `input` order.\n\n#### input\n\nType: `Iterable<Promise | unknown>`\n\nIterated over concurrently in the `mapper` function.\n\n#### mapper(element, index)\n\nType: `Function`\n\nExpected to return a `Promise` or value.\n\n#### options\n\nType: `object`\n\n##### concurrency\n\nType: `number` (Integer)\\\nDefault: `Infinity`\\\nMinimum: `1`\n\nNumber of concurrently pending promises returned by `mapper`.\n\n##### stopOnError\n\nType: `boolean`\\\nDefault: `true`\n\nWhen set to `false`, instead of stopping when a promise rejects, it will wait for all the promises to settle and then reject with an [aggregated error](https://github.com/sindresorhus/aggregate-error) containing all the errors from the rejected promises.\n\n## p-map for enterprise\n\nAvailable as part of the Tidelift Subscription.\n\nThe maintainers of p-map and thousands of other packages are working with Tidelift to deliver commercial support and maintenance for the open source dependencies you use to build your applications.
