It may callback with data, with an error or with no arguments, \n\n  * `callback()` drop this data.  \n    this makes the map work like `filter`,  \n    note:`callback(null,null)` is not the same, and will emit `null`\n\n  * `callback(null, newData)` turn data into newData\n    \n  * `callback(error)` emit an error for this item.\n\n>Note: if a callback is not called, `map` will think that it is still being processed,   \n>every call must be answered or the stream will not know when to end.  \n>\n>Also, if the callback is called more than once, every call but the first will be ignored.\n\n##Options \n\n * `failures` - `boolean` continue mapping even if error occured. On error `map-stream` will emit `failure` event.
