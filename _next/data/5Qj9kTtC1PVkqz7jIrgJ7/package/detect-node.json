This check is both **the most reliable I could find** and it does not use `process` env directly, which would cause browserify to include it into the build.\n","homepage":"https://github.com/iliakan/detect-node","trustScore":25,"sourceRank":{"basic_info_present":1,"repository_present":1,"readme_present":1,"license_present":1,"versions_present":1,"follows_semver":1,"recent_release":0,"not_brand_new":1,"one_point_oh":1,"dependent_projects":6,"dependent_repositories":6,"stars":2,"contributors":1,"subscribers":2,"all_prereleases":0,"any_outdated_dependencies":0,"is_deprecated":0,"is_unmaintained":0,"is_removed":0,"trustScore":25},"versions":[{"versionNumber":"1.0.0","timestamp":"2014-07-31T10:20:21.252Z","trustScore":12,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.0","timestamp":"2014-07-31T10:30:55.255Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.1","timestamp":"2014-07-31T10:34:58.862Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.2","timestamp":"2014-07-31T10:36:39.833Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.3","timestamp":"2014-08-01T16:28:40.851Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.4","timestamp":"2018-08-31T15:52:23.291Z","trustScore":25,"dependencies":[]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
