Chain tasks together to build projects with ease.\n\nFeatures:\n\n * Basic building blocks that can be combined to perform complex builds.\n * Tasks are simply defined and keep system internals to a minimum.\n * Asynchronous execution.\n * Extensible task loading via NPM, file, or directory.\n * Advanced flow control for complex task execution.\n * Runs in Node.js and the browser.\n\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/twobit/gear.png)](http://travis-ci.org/twobit/gear)\n\n[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/gear.png?downloads=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/gear/)\n\n## Installation\n\nTo get the most out of Gear.js, you will want to install [gear-lib](http://github.com/yahoo/gear-lib) which contains tasks for linting, minifying, and deploying JS/CSS assets.\n\n```bash\n$ npm install gear gear-lib\n```\n\n## Quick Examples\n\n### Chaining Tasks\n\n```javascript\nnew Queue()\n .read('foo.js')\n .log('read foo.js')\n .inspect()\n .write('foobarbaz.js')\n .run();\n```\n\n### Execute Tasks Using Array Style\n\n```javascript\nnew Queue()\n .read(['foo.js', {name: 'bar.js'}, 'baz.js'])\n .log('read foo.js')\n .inspect()\n .write(['newfoo.js', 'newbar.js']) // Not writing 'baz.js'\n .run();\n```\n\n### Parallel Task Execution\n\n```javascript\nnew Queue()\n .read('foo.js')\n .log('Parallel Tasks')\n .tasks({\n    read:     {task: ['read', ['foo.js', 'bar.js', 'baz.js']]},\n    combine:  {requires: 'read', task: 'concat'},\n    minify:   {requires: 'combine', task: 'jsminify'},\n    print:    {requires: 'minify', task: 'inspect'}, // Runs when read, combine, and minify complete\n    parallel: {task: ['log', \"Hello Gear.js world!\"]} // Run parallel to read\n }).run();\n```\n\n * [Documentation](http://gearjs.org)\n *
