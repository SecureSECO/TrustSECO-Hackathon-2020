Available in npm and Ender as **prr**.\n\n## Usage\n\nSet the property `'foo'` (`obj.foo`) to have the value `'bar'` with default options (`'enumerable'`, `'configurable'` and `'writable'` are all `false`):\n\n```js\nprr(obj, 'foo', 'bar')\n```\n\nAdjust the default options:\n\n```js\nprr(obj, 'foo', 'bar', { enumerable: true, writable: true })\n```\n\nDo the same operation for multiple properties:\n\n```js\nprr(obj, { one: 'one', two: 'two' })\n// or with options:\nprr(obj, { one: 'one', two: 'two' }, { enumerable: true, writable: true })\n```\n\n### Simplify!\n\nBut obviously, having to write out the full options object makes it nearly as bad as the original `Object.defineProperty()` so we can simplify.\n\nAs an alternative method we can use an options string where each character represents a option: `'e'=='enumerable'`, `'c'=='configurable'` and `'w'=='writable'`:\n\n```js\nprr(obj, 'foo', 'bar', 'ew') // enumerable and writable but not configurable\n// muliple properties:\nprr(obj, { one: 'one', two: 'two' }, 'ewc') // configurable too\n```\n\n## Where can I use it?\n\nAnywhere! For pre-ES5 environments *prr* will simply fall-back to an `object[property] = value` so you can get close to what you want.\n\n*prr* is Ender-compatible so you can include it in your Ender build and `$.prr(...)` or `var prr = require('prr'); prr(...)`.\n\n## Licence\n\nprr is Copyright (c) 2013 Rod Vagg [@rvagg](https://twitter.com/rvagg) and licensed under the MIT licence.
