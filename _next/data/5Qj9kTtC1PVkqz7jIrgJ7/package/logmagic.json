It doesn't do everything it should, yet.\n\nThe goal is to have a fast and easy to use logging subsystem that can be dynamically\nreconfigured to provide insight into production systems.\n\nLogmagic does its magic by generating objects with generated functions that are only modified\nwhen the logging system is reconfigured,  thus your entire logging path is contained within \nlong-lived functions that V8 is able to JIT.\n\nGetting Started\n====================\n\nIf you had a file named like, \"lib/foo/bar.js\", at the top of it, you would put the following:\n\n    var log = require('logmagic').local('mylib.foo.bar');\n\nThen inside bar.js, you would just use the logger like any normal logger:\n\n    log.info(\"Hello!\")\n    log.error(\"By default, format strings are not used.\", {SOME_VAR: \"myvalue\"})\n    log.errorf(\"Just add 'f' to any log method, and you get format strings too: ${SOME_VAR}\", {SOME_VAR: \"myvalue\"})\n\nIn any other part of your application, you can reconfigure the logging subsystem at runtime,\nmaking it easy to change log levels for specific modules dynamically.\n\n    var logmagic = require('logmagic');\n    logmagic.registerSink(\"mysink\", function(module, level, message) { console.log(message); });\n    \n    /* Send Info an higher in the root logger to stdout */\n    logmagic.route(\"__root__\", logmagic.INFO, \"stdout\")\n    \n    /* Reconfigure all children of mylib to log all debug messages to your custom sink */\n    logmagic.route(\"mylib.*\", logmagic.DEBUG, \"mysink\")\n\n\nBuiltin sinks include:\n\n* stderr\n* Graylog2-style JSON to stderr\n\nFuture features:\n\n* Standard Out\n* Facebook Scribe: https://github.com/facebook/scribe\n* File\n* Unix Socket\n* Syslog\n","homepage":"https://github.com/pquerna/node-logmagic","trustScore":13,"sourceRank":{"basic_info_present":1,"repository_present":1,"readme_present":1,"license_present":1,"versions_present":1,"follows_semver":1,"recent_release":0,"not_brand_new":1,"one_point_oh":0,"dependent_projects":2,"dependent_repositories":2,"stars":2,"contributors":1,"subscribers":0,"all_prereleases":0,"any_outdated_dependencies":-1,"is_deprecated":0,"is_unmaintained":0,"is_removed":0,"trustScore":13},"versions":[{"versionNumber":"0.1.0","timestamp":"2011-03-29T16:46:45.722Z","trustScore":5,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.1","timestamp":"2011-03-29T18:47:48.469Z","trustScore":5,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.2","timestamp":"2011-06-24T23:47:51.743Z","trustScore":6,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.3","timestamp":"2011-07-01T22:12:36.585Z","trustScore":5,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.4","timestamp":"2011-07-17T17:13:32.755Z","trustScore":6,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.2.0","timestamp":"2015-05-20T00:43:39.986Z","trustScore":5,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"chalk","version":"^1.0.0"},{"packageName":"moment","version":"^2.10.2"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.2.1","timestamp":"2015-05-20T01:14:23.403Z","trustScore":5,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"chalk","version":"^1.0.0"},{"packageName":"moment","version":"^2.10.2"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.2.2","timestamp":"2015-05-20T01:23:03.112Z","trustScore":6,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"chalk","version":"^1.0.0"},{"packageName":"moment","version":"^2.10.2"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.2.3","timestamp":"2015-05-20T21:28:39.807Z","trustScore":5,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"chalk","version":"^1.0.0"},{"packageName":"moment","version":"^2.10.2"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.2.4","timestamp":"2015-05-26T16:12:55.322Z","trustScore":5,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"chalk","version":"^1.0.0"},{"packageName":"moment","version":"^2.10.2"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.2.5","timestamp":"2015-06-05T01:11:02.484Z","trustScore":6,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"chalk","version":"^1.0.0"},{"packageName":"moment","version":"^2.10.2"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.3.0","timestamp":"2015-07-01T21:33:27.323Z","trustScore":13,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"chalk","version":"^1.0.0"},{"packageName":"moment","version":"^2.10.2"}]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
