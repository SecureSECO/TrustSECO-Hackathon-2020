See example below.\n\n### Install\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save find-up-sync\n```\n\n### Example\n\nAssume your filesystem has a structure like this:\n```\n/\n└── home\n    └── pvieira\n        └── my-app\n            ├── config\n                └── email-key.txt\n            └── xyz\n                └── abc\n                    └── find-key.js\n```\n\nWe want to obtain the path to `config/email-key.txt` from any module in the application, without using relative paths or any other dependency specific to the application (such as a global `__rootDir` variable).\n\nThe `find-key.js` module will find the path:\n```js\nvar FindUp = require('find-up-sync');\nvar path = FindUp('config/email-key.txt');\n\n// path === '/home/pvieira/my-app/config/email-key.txt'\n```\n\n### Related modules\n\n- `find-up` - https://www.npmjs.com/package/find-up\n- `look-up` - https://www.npmjs.com/package/look-up\n- `find-config` - https://www.npmjs.com/package/find-config\n\n","homepage":"https://github.com/paulovieira/find-up-sync#readme","trustScore":8,"sourceRank":{"basic_info_present":1,"repository_present":1,"readme_present":1,"license_present":1,"versions_present":1,"follows_semver":1,"recent_release":0,"not_brand_new":1,"one_point_oh":1,"dependent_projects":0,"dependent_repositories":0,"stars":0,"contributors":0,"subscribers":0,"all_prereleases":0,"any_outdated_dependencies":0,"is_deprecated":0,"is_unmaintained":0,"is_removed":0,"trustScore":8},"versions":[{"versionNumber":"1.0.0","timestamp":"2016-05-12T10:38:52.389Z","trustScore":4,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.1","timestamp":"2016-05-12T11:07:28.403Z","trustScore":4,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.2","timestamp":"2016-05-12T11:13:30.429Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
