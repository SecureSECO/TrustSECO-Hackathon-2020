// Read JPEG header\n  if (bytesRead === 20) {\n    console.log('Got the JPEG header');\n  } else {\n    throw Error('Failed to read JPEG header');\n  }\n})();\n```\n\nIf you have to skip a part of the data, you can use ignore:\n```js\nawait streamReader.ignore(16);\n```\n\n","homepage":"https://github.com/Borewit/then-read-stream#readme","trustScore":10,"sourceRank":{"basic_info_present":1,"repository_present":1,"readme_present":1,"license_present":1,"versions_present":1,"follows_semver":1,"recent_release":0,"not_brand_new":1,"one_point_oh":1,"dependent_projects":0,"dependent_repositories":2,"stars":0,"contributors":0,"subscribers":0,"all_prereleases":0,"any_outdated_dependencies":0,"is_deprecated":0,"is_unmaintained":0,"is_removed":0,"trustScore":10},"versions":[{"versionNumber":"0.0.5","timestamp":"2017-06-25T18:47:30.395Z","trustScore":5,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.6","timestamp":"2017-06-26T17:41:00.175Z","trustScore":4,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.0","timestamp":"2017-07-02T14:06:06.212Z","trustScore":5,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.9.0","timestamp":"2017-07-17T07:32:43.456Z","trustScore":4,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.9.1","timestamp":"2017-07-17T07:40:36.661Z","trustScore":4,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.9.2","timestamp":"2017-08-11T18:52:42.294Z","trustScore":5,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.9.3","timestamp":"2017-08-12T19:42:51.030Z","trustScore":5,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.9.4","timestamp":"2017-08-14T06:46:28.068Z","trustScore":5,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.9.5","timestamp":"2017-08-19T09:27:17.014Z","trustScore":4,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.9.6","timestamp":"2017-08-22T07:29:48.055Z","trustScore":4,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.0","timestamp":"2017-08-30T18:57:01.019Z","trustScore":4,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.1","timestamp":"2017-08-31T18:31:19.844Z","trustScore":5,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.2","timestamp":"2017-09-02T07:04:29.294Z","trustScore":5,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.3","timestamp":"2017-09-02T12:31:38.900Z","trustScore":4,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.4","timestamp":"2017-09-22T17:54:37.603Z","trustScore":4,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.5","timestamp":"2018-02-05T17:55:21.300Z","trustScore":4,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"es6-promise","version":"^4.2.4"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.6","timestamp":"2018-04-24T20:00:28.998Z","trustScore":4,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"es6-promise","version":"^4.2.4"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.1.0","timestamp":"2018-04-25T05:40:54.659Z","trustScore":5,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"bluebird","version":"^3.5.1"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.1.1","timestamp":"2018-04-29T07:26:22.423Z","trustScore":5,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"bluebird","version":"^3.5.1"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.1.2","timestamp":"2018-05-08T18:33:05.275Z","trustScore":4,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"bluebird","version":"^3.5.1"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.1.3","timestamp":"2018-05-08T19:41:18.935Z","trustScore":5,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"bluebird","version":"^3.5.1"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.2.0","timestamp":"2018-06-24T11:16:15.361Z","trustScore":4,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"es6-promise","version":"^4.2.4"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.2.1","timestamp":"2018-07-01T09:41:26.700Z","trustScore":5,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"es6-promise","version":"^4.2.4"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.3.0","timestamp":"2018-09-11T22:04:14.813Z","trustScore":4,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.3.1","timestamp":"2018-09-29T10:41:48.912Z","trustScore":5,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.4.0","timestamp":"2018-11-26T20:45:11.344Z","trustScore":4,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.5.0","timestamp":"2018-12-16T12:18:41.252Z","trustScore":4,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.5.1","timestamp":"2019-06-05T19:09:45.141Z","trustScore":5,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.0","timestamp":"2019-06-05T19:46:46.229Z","trustScore":5,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.6","timestamp":"2019-09-07T13:22:27.704Z","trustScore":5,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.7","timestamp":"2019-10-16T18:28:37.419Z","trustScore":6,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.8","timestamp":"2019-11-01T11:41:51.351Z","trustScore":5,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"3.0.0","timestamp":"2019-12-24T14:49:19.653Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
