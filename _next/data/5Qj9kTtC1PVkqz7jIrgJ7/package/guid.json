Lets check the\nvalidity of our Guid using the built-in validator:\n\n    Guid.isGuid(guid);\n    // -> true\n    \n    Guid.value;\n    // -> '6fdf6ffc-ed77-94fa-407e-a7b86ed9e59d'\n\nA handy bit of functionality is that its `toString` method returns the string\nvalue, so you can do handy things like this:\n\n    var itemUrl = \"http://whatever.com/items/\" + guid;\n    // -> 'http://whatever.com/items/6fdf6ffc-ed77-94fa-407e-a7b86ed9e59d'\n    \nIf you need a placeholder Guid, or a value to represent a non-GUID, use the\nstatic `EMPTY` property:\n\n    Guid.EMPTY;\n    // -> '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000'\n\nOnce you have a `Guid` object, you can't change its value (thanks ES5!):\n\n    guid.value = \"go suck it, guid!\"\n    guid.value;\n    // -> '6fdf6ffc-ed77-94fa-407e-a7b86ed9e59d'\n\nTo instantiate an Guid object using an existing GUID string, use the constructor:\n\n    var guid = new Guid('6fdf6ffc-ed77-94fa-407e-a7b86ed9e59d');\n\nYou can check the equality of two different Guid objects using the `equals`\ninstance method.\n\nCompare a Guid object to a GUID string:\n\n    guid.equals('6fdf6ffc-ed77-94fa-407e-a7b86ed9e59d');\n    // -> true\n\nCompare two Guid objects:\n    \n    guid.equals(new Guid('6fdf6ffc-ed77-94fa-407e-a7b86ed9e59d'));\n    // -> true\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can use npm to install guid: `npm install guid`\n\n\n## But what if I need a UUID, not a GUID?\n\nThere's also a [Uuid](https://github.com/dandean/uuid-lib) library which has the\n**exact** same functionality, but for UUID's:\n[https://github.com/dandean/uuid-lib](https://github.com/dandean/uuid-lib)\n\n","homepage":"https://github.com/dandean/guid","trustScore":17,"sourceRank":{"basic_info_present":1,"repository_present":1,"readme_present":1,"license_present":1,"versions_present":1,"follows_semver":1,"recent_release":0,"not_brand_new":1,"one_point_oh":0,"dependent_projects":4,"dependent_repositories":3,"stars":2,"contributors":0,"subscribers":1,"all_prereleases":0,"any_outdated_dependencies":0,"is_deprecated":0,"is_unmaintained":0,"is_removed":0,"trustScore":17},"versions":[{"versionNumber":"0.0.5","timestamp":"2011-07-13T06:18:20.454Z","trustScore":7,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.6","timestamp":"2011-07-13T06:18:20.454Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.7","timestamp":"2011-07-13T06:18:20.454Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.8","timestamp":"2011-07-13T06:20:11.963Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.9","timestamp":"2011-07-13T06:28:39.676Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.10","timestamp":"2011-07-13T06:31:43.011Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.11","timestamp":"2013-11-20T05:38:07.251Z","trustScore":7,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.12","timestamp":"2013-12-20T23:35:16.453Z","trustScore":17,"dependencies":[]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
