Modularity!\nEspecially handy if you're serving to the browser and need to reduce your\njavascript bundle size.\n\nWorks great in the browser with\n[browserify](http://github.com/substack/node-browserify)!\n\n## See Also\n- [promise-each](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/promise-each)\n- [promise-every](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/promise-every)\n- [promise-filter](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/promise-filter)\n- [promise-map](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/promise-map)\n- [promise-some](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/promise-some)\n\n## License\n[MIT](https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license)\n\n[npm-image]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/promise-reduce.svg?style=flat-square\n[npm-url]: https://npmjs.org/package/promise-reduce\n[travis-image]: https://img.shields.io/travis/yoshuawuyts/promise-reduce.svg?style=flat-square\n[travis-url]: https://travis-ci.org/yoshuawuyts/promise-reduce\n[coveralls-image]: https://img.shields.io/coveralls/yoshuawuyts/promise-reduce.svg?style=flat-square\n[coveralls-url]: https://coveralls.io/r/yoshuawuyts/promise-reduce?branch=master\n[downloads-image]: http://img.shields.io/npm/dm/promise-reduce.svg?style=flat-square\n[downloads-url]: https://npmjs.org/package/promise-reduce\n\n[mdn]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce\n[promise]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise\n[bluebird]: https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird/blob/master/API.md#reducefunction-reducer--dynamic-initialvalue---promise\n","homepage":"https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/promise-reduce#readme","trustScore":12,"sourceRank":{"basic_info_present":1,"repository_present":1,"readme_present":1,"license_present":1,"versions_present":1,"follows_semver":1,"recent_release":0,"not_brand_new":1,"one_point_oh":1,"dependent_projects":2,"dependent_repositories":2,"stars":1,"contributors":0,"subscribers":0,"all_prereleases":0,"any_outdated_dependencies":-1,"is_deprecated":0,"is_unmaintained":0,"is_removed":0,"trustScore":12},"versions":[{"versionNumber":"1.0.1","timestamp":"2015-01-24T04:02:32.930Z","trustScore":5,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"native-or-bluebird","version":"^1.1.2"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.1.0","timestamp":"2015-07-11T01:44:08.198Z","trustScore":5,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"any-promise","version":"^0.1.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.0","timestamp":"2015-07-21T13:13:12.355Z","trustScore":5,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"any-promise","version":"^0.1.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"2.1.0","timestamp":"2016-07-07T15:25:15.451Z","trustScore":12,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"any-promise","version":"^0.1.0"}]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
