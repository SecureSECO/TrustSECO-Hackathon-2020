While many terminals have long detected URL's and linkified them, allowing you to Command-Click or Control-Click them to open a browser, you were forced to print the long unsightly URL's on the screen. As of spring 2017 [a few terminals](https://gist.github.com/egmontkob/eb114294efbcd5adb1944c9f3cb5feda) began supporting HTML like links, where the link text and destination could be specified separately.\n\nThis module allows you to detect if hyperlinks are supported in the current Terminal.\n\nAs this is a new development, we anticipate the list of supported Terminals to grow rapidly. Please open an issue or submit a PR as new Terminals implement support.\n\n## Install\n\n```\n$ npm install supports-hyperlinks\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nconst supportsHyperlinks = require('supports-hyperlinks');\n\nif (supportsHyperlinks.stdout) {\n\tconsole.log('Terminal stdout supports hyperlinks');\n}\n\nif (supportsHyperlinks.stderr) {\n\tconsole.log('Terminal stderr supports hyperlinks');\n}\n```\n\n## API\n\nReturns an `Object` with a `stdout` and `stderr` property for testing either streams. Each property is a `boolean`, indicating whether or not hyperlinks are supported.\n\n## Info\n\nObeys the `--no-hyperlinks`, `--hyperlink=always`, and `--hyperlink=never` CLI flags.\n\nCan be overridden by the user with the flags `--hyperlinks=always` and `--no-hyperlinks`. For situations where using those flags are not possible, add the environment variable `FORCE_HYPERLINK=1` to forcefully enable hyperlinks or `FORCE_HYPERLINK=0` to forcefully disable. The use of `FORCE_HYPERLINK` overrides all other hyperlink support checks.\n\n## Related\n\n  * [`hyperlinker`](https://github.com/jamestalmage/hyperlinker): Write hyperlinks for the Terminal.\n\n## License\n\nMIT Â© [James Talmage](https://github.com/jamestalmage)\n","homepage":"https://github.com/jamestalmage/supports-hyperlinks#readme","trustScore":18,"sourceRank":{"basic_info_present":1,"repository_present":1,"readme_present":1,"license_present":1,"versions_present":1,"follows_semver":1,"recent_release":0,"not_brand_new":1,"one_point_oh":1,"dependent_projects":4,"dependent_repositories":4,"stars":1,"contributors":0,"subscribers":1,"all_prereleases":0,"any_outdated_dependencies":0,"is_deprecated":0,"is_unmaintained":0,"is_removed":0,"trustScore":18},"versions":[{"versionNumber":"1.0.0","timestamp":"2017-11-28T01:20:21.493Z","trustScore":7,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"has-flag","version":"^2.0.0"},{"packageName":"supports-color","version":"^5.0.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.1","timestamp":"2017-11-28T01:50:58.193Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"has-flag","version":"^2.0.0"},{"packageName":"supports-color","version":"^5.0.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.0","timestamp":"2019-07-17T18:11:12.257Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"has-flag","version":"^4.0.0"},{"packageName":"supports-color","version":"^7.0.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"2.1.0","timestamp":"2020-02-07T00:13:57.198Z","trustScore":18,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"has-flag","version":"^4.0.0"},{"packageName":"supports-color","version":"^7.0.0"}]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
