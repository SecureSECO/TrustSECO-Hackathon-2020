This is intended to allow you to\neasily have prepublish lifecycle scripts that don't run when you run `npm install`.\n\n```\n$ npm install --save-dev in-publish\nin-publish@1.0.0 node_modules/in-publish\n```\n\nThen edit your package.json to have:\n\n```json\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"prepublish\": \"in-publish && thing-I-dont-want-on-dev-install || not-in-publish\"\n  }\n```\n\nNow when you run:\n\n```\n$ npm install\n```\nThen `thing-I-dont-want-on-dev-install` won't be run, but...\n\n```\n$ npm publish\n```\nAnd `thing-I-dont-want-on-dev-install` will be run.\n\nIt's worth noting that the `prepublish` lifecycle is _ALSO_ called when you build a tarball, so:\n\n```\n$ npm pack\n```\n\nWill call your `prepublish` lifecycle, but with the example above,\n`thing-I-dont-want-on-dev-install` won't be run.\n\nIf you want this, you can use another helper included here:\n\n```json\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"prepublish\": \"not-in-install && thing-I-dont-want-on-dev-install || in-install\"\n  }\n```\n\nThe above will run your `thing-I-dont-want-on-dev-install` on `publish` and\non `pack` but not on `install`.\n","homepage":"https://github.com/iarna/in-publish","trustScore":23,"sourceRank":{"basic_info_present":1,"repository_present":1,"readme_present":1,"license_present":1,"versions_present":1,"follows_semver":1,"recent_release":0,"not_brand_new":1,"one_point_oh":1,"dependent_projects":6,"dependent_repositories":5,"stars":2,"contributors":1,"subscribers":1,"all_prereleases":0,"any_outdated_dependencies":0,"is_deprecated":0,"is_unmaintained":0,"is_removed":0,"trustScore":23},"versions":[{"versionNumber":"1.0.0","timestamp":"2015-01-13T03:26:01.320Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.1.0","timestamp":"2015-01-13T04:25:48.596Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.1.1","timestamp":"2015-01-13T05:06:26.928Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.0","timestamp":"2015-07-07T19:01:29.155Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.1","timestamp":"2020-03-16T19:50:05.783Z","trustScore":23,"dependencies":[]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
