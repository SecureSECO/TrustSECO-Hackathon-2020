It's a powerful combination of small size, high performance, debuggability, and rich features:\n\n* Resolve arrays and hashes of promises, as well as infinite promise sequences\n* Execute tasks in parallel or sequentially\n* Transform Node-style and other callback-based APIs into promise-based APIs\n\nWhen.js is one of the many stand-alone components of [cujoJS](http://cujojs.com), the JavaScript Architectural Toolkit. \n\nCheck it out:\n\n- [What's new](CHANGES.md)\n- [API docs](docs/api.md#api)\n- Read more about how [promises simplify async programming](http://know.cujojs.com/tutorials/async/simplifying-async-with-promises)\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n#### AMD\n\nAvailable as `when` through [bower](http://bower.io), or just clone the repo and load `when.js` from the root.\n\n```\nbower install --save when\n```\n\n#### CommonJS/Node\n\n```\nnpm install --save when\n```\n\n[More help & other environments &raquo;](docs/installation.md)\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nPromises can be used to help manage complex and/or nested callback flows in a simple manner. To get a better handle on how promise flows look and how they can be helpful, there are a couple examples below (using commonjs).\n\nThis first example will print `\"hello world!!!!\"` if all went well, or `\"drat!\"` if there was a problem. It also uses [rest](https://github.com/cujojs/rest) to make an ajax request to a (fictional) external service.\n\n```js\nvar rest = require('rest');\n\nfetchRemoteGreeting()\n    .then(addExclamation)\n    .catch(handleError)\n    .done(function(greeting) {\n        console.log(greeting);\n    });\n\nfunction fetchRemoteGreeting() {\n    // returns a when.js promise for 'hello world'\n    return rest('http://example.com/greeting');\n}\n\nfunction addExclamation(greeting) {\n    return greeting + '!!!!'\n}\n\nfunction handleError(e) {\n    return 'drat!';\n}\n```\n\nThe second example shows off the power that comes with when's promise logic. Here, we get an array of numbers from a remote source and reduce them. The example will print `150` if all went well, and if there was a problem will print a full stack trace.\n\n```js\nvar when = require('when');\nvar rest = require('rest');\n\nwhen.reduce(when.map(getRemoteNumberList(), times10), sum)\n    .done(function(result) {\n        console.log(result);\n    });\n\nfunction getRemoteNumberList() {\n    // Get a remote array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    return rest('http://example.com/numbers').then(JSON.parse);\n}\n\nfunction sum(x, y) { return x + y; }\nfunction times10(x) {return x * 10; }\n```\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nLicensed under MIT.
