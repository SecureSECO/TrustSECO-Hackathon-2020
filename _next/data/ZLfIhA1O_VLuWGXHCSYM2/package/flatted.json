// [[\"1\",\"0\"],{\"a\":\"0\"}]\n```\n\n## Flatted VS JSON\n\nAs it is for every other specialized format capable of serializing and deserializing circular data, you should never `JSON.parse(Flatted.stringify(data))`, and you should never `Flatted.parse(JSON.stringify(data))`.\n\nThe only way this could work is to `Flatted.parse(Flatted.stringify(data))`, as it is also for _CircularJSON_ or any other, otherwise there's no granted data integrity.\n\nAlso please note this project serializes and deserializes only data compatible with JSON, so that sockets, or anything else with internal classes different from those allowed by JSON standard, won't be serialized and unserialized as expected.\n\n\n### New in V1: Exact same JSON API\n\n  * Added a [reviver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse#Syntax) parameter to `.parse(string, reviver)` and revive your own objects.\n  * Added a [replacer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify#Syntax) and a `space` parameter to `.stringify(object, replacer, space)` for feature parity with JSON signature.\n\n\n### Compatibility\nAll ECMAScript engines compatible with `Map`, `Set`, `Object.keys`, and `Array.prototype.reduce` will work, even if polyfilled.\n\n\n### How does it work ?\nWhile stringifying, all Objects, including Arrays, and strings, are flattened out and replaced as unique index. `*`\n\nOnce parsed, all indexes will be replaced through the flattened collection.\n\n<sup><sub>`*` represented as string to avoid conflicts with numbers</sub></sup>\n\n```js\n// logic example\nvar a = [{one: 1}, {two: '2'}];\na[0].a = a;\n// a is the main object, will be at index '0'\n// {one: 1} is the second object, index '1'\n// {two: '2'} the third, in '2', and it has a string\n// which will be found at index '3'\n\nFlatted.stringify(a);\n// [[\"1\",\"2\"],{\"one\":1,\"a\":\"0\"},{\"two\":\"3\"},\"2\"]\n// a[one,two]    {one: 1, a}    {two: '2'}  '2'\n```\n","homepage":"https://github.com/WebReflection/flatted#readme","trustScore":26,"sourceRank":{"basic_info_present":1,"repository_present":1,"readme_present":1,"license_present":1,"versions_present":1,"follows_semver":1,"recent_release":1,"not_brand_new":1,"one_point_oh":1,"dependent_projects":6,"dependent_repositories":5,"stars":3,"contributors":1,"subscribers":2,"all_prereleases":0,"any_outdated_dependencies":0,"is_deprecated":0,"is_unmaintained":0,"is_removed":0,"trustScore":26},"versions":[{"versionNumber":"0.1.0","timestamp":"2018-04-26T09:50:37.595Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"coveralls","version":"^3.0.0"},{"packageName":"istanbul","version":"^0.4.5"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.2.0","timestamp":"2018-04-26T11:58:50.371Z","trustScore":12,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"coveralls","version":"^3.0.0"},{"packageName":"istanbul","version":"^0.4.5"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.2.1","timestamp":"2018-04-27T17:03:24.657Z","trustScore":13,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"coveralls","version":"^3.0.0"},{"packageName":"istanbul","version":"^0.4.5"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.2.2","timestamp":"2018-05-29T16:54:24.427Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.2.3","timestamp":"2018-07-03T17:22:36.473Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.0","timestamp":"2018-09-18T17:02:20.547Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.1","timestamp":"2018-09-19T07:06:24.413Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.2","timestamp":"2018-09-21T03:46:50.505Z","trustScore":12,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.3","timestamp":"2018-10-11T08:35:32.528Z","trustScore":12,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.0","timestamp":"2018-10-22T07:49:06.657Z","trustScore":12,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.1","timestamp":"2019-06-25T12:36:44.430Z","trustScore":13,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.2","timestamp":"2020-03-29T08:05:56.847Z","trustScore":17,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"3.0.0","timestamp":"2020-05-26T17:14:20.822Z","trustScore":24,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"3.0.1","timestamp":"2020-05-26T17:19:57.029Z","trustScore":24,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"3.0.2","timestamp":"2020-05-26T18:18:47.701Z","trustScore":22,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"3.0.3","timestamp":"2020-07-05T12:10:30.364Z","trustScore":25,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"3.0.4","timestamp":"2020-07-05T12:17:28.985Z","trustScore":24,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"3.0.5","timestamp":"2020-09-10T08:52:29.670Z","trustScore":25,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"3.1.0","timestamp":"2020-09-30T05:37:46.008Z","trustScore":26,"dependencies":[]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
