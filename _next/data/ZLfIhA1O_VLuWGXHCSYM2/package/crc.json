This affected all version starting from `6.3.0` up to but not including `6.9.2`. The patch [#9341](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/9341) was released in `6.9.2`. If you are upgrading and seeing odd CRC calculation mismatches, this might be the reason.\n\n## Running tests\n\n```\nnpm test\n```\n\n## Thanks!\n\n[pycrc](http://www.tty1.net/pycrc/) library is which the source of all of the CRC tables.\n\n# License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2014 Alex Gorbatchev\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
