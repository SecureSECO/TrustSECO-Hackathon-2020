This means `readline2` change some behaviors and as so is **not** meant to be an exact drop-in replacement.\n\nThis project is extracted from the core of [Inquirer.js interactive prompt interface](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js) to be available as a standalone module.\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\n**Installation**: `npm install --save readline2`\n\n### readline2.createInterface(options); -> {Interface}\n\nPresent the same API as [Node.js `readline.createInterface()`](http://nodejs.org/api/readline.html)\n\n#### Improvements\n- Default `options.input` as `process.stdin`\n- Default `options.output` as `process.stdout`\n- `interface.stdout` is wrapped in a [MuteStream](https://github.com/isaacs/mute-stream)\n- Prevent `up` and `down` keys from moving through history inside the readline\n- Fix cursor position after a line refresh when the `Interface` prompt contains ANSI colors\n- Correctly return the cursor position when faced with implicit line returns\n\n\nLicense\n-------------\n\nCopyright (c) 2012 Simon Boudrias (twitter: [@vaxilart](https://twitter.com/Vaxilart))\nLicensed under the MIT license.\n","homepage":"https://github.com/sboudrias/readline2#readme","trustScore":18,"sourceRank":{"basic_info_present":1,"repository_present":1,"readme_present":1,"license_present":1,"versions_present":1,"follows_semver":1,"recent_release":0,"not_brand_new":1,"one_point_oh":1,"dependent_projects":4,"dependent_repositories":5,"stars":1,"contributors":0,"subscribers":1,"all_prereleases":0,"any_outdated_dependencies":-1,"is_deprecated":0,"is_unmaintained":0,"is_removed":0,"trustScore":18},"versions":[{"versionNumber":"0.1.0","timestamp":"2014-02-01T05:17:15.686Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"mute-stream","version":"0.0.4"},{"packageName":"lodash","version":"~2.4.1"},{"packageName":"chalk","version":"~0.4.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.1","timestamp":"2015-01-21T06:55:37.493Z","trustScore":8,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"mute-stream","version":"0.0.4"},{"packageName":"strip-ansi","version":"^2.0.1"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.0","timestamp":"2015-07-17T07:03:39.683Z","trustScore":7,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"code-point-at","version":"^1.0.0"},{"packageName":"is-fullwidth-code-point","version":"^1.0.0"},{"packageName":"mute-stream","version":"^0.0.4"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.1","timestamp":"2015-07-17T07:05:50.142Z","trustScore":18,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"code-point-at","version":"^1.0.0"},{"packageName":"is-fullwidth-code-point","version":"^1.0.0"},{"packageName":"mute-stream","version":"0.0.5"}]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
