This should usually work in a linux environment, but will also fallback to looking at user specific environment variables to build the user's home directory if neccessary.\n\nSince `/etc/passwd` is not available on windows platforms, this implementation will use environment variables to find the home directory.\n\nIn modern versions of node.js, [os.homedir](https://nodejs.org/api/os.html#os_os_homedir) is used.\n\n## About\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Contributing</strong></summary>\n\nPull requests and stars are always welcome.
