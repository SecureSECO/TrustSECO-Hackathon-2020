If a callback function is\nprovided, then it's attached to the Promise.\n\n## Options\n\n* `force` like `touch -f` Boolean\n* `time` like `touch -t <date>` Can be a Date object, or any parseable\n  Date string, or epoch ms number.\n* `atime` like `touch -a` Can be either a Boolean, or a Date.\n* `mtime` like `touch -m` Can be either a Boolean, or a Date.\n* `ref` like `touch -r <file>` Must be path to a file.\n* `nocreate` like `touch -c` Boolean\n\nIf neither `atime` nor `mtime` are set, then both values are set.  If\none of them is set, then the other is not.\n\n## cli\n\nThis package creates a `nodetouch` command line executable that works\nvery much like the unix builtin `touch(1)`\n","homepage":"https://github.com/isaacs/node-touch#readme","trustScore":21,"sourceRank":{"basic_info_present":1,"repository_present":1,"readme_present":1,"license_present":1,"versions_present":1,"follows_semver":1,"recent_release":0,"not_brand_new":1,"one_point_oh":1,"dependent_projects":6,"dependent_repositories":5,"stars":2,"contributors":0,"subscribers":1,"all_prereleases":0,"any_outdated_dependencies":-1,"is_deprecated":0,"is_unmaintained":0,"is_removed":0,"trustScore":21},"versions":[{"versionNumber":"0.0.1","timestamp":"2011-10-05T22:13:25.389Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"nopt","version":"~1.0.10"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.2","timestamp":"2012-07-12T21:41:21.259Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"nopt","version":"~1.0.10"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.3","timestamp":"2014-01-25T01:57:35.319Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"nopt","version":"~1.0.10"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.4","timestamp":"2015-07-15T18:34:56.019Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"nopt","version":"~1.0.10"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.0","timestamp":"2015-07-17T00:38:40.004Z","trustScore":10,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"nopt","version":"~1.0.10"}]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.0","timestamp":"2017-06-27T17:23:00.394Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"nopt","version":"~1.0.10"}]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.1","timestamp":"2017-06-27T17:23:46.567Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"nopt","version":"~1.0.10"}]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.2","timestamp":"2017-06-27T17:37:00.354Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"nopt","version":"~1.0.10"}]},{"versionNumber":"3.0.0","timestamp":"2017-06-30T00:59:54.118Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"nopt","version":"~1.0.10"}]},{"versionNumber":"3.1.0","timestamp":"2017-06-30T23:40:39.606Z","trustScore":21,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"nopt","version":"~1.0.10"}]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
