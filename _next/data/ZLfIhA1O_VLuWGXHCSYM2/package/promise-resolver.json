Most promise implementations emit\n [`unhandledRejection`](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_event_unhandledrejection) events.\n If a callback is provided, \n [`unhandledRejection`](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_event_unhandledrejection) \n events are be suppressed (it is assumed the callback handles any errors).\n \n \n#### Safe Callbacks\n\n`promise-resolver` protects against callback misuse in the following ways:\n\n```js\nfunction doStuff (cb) {\n  var deferred = promiseResolver(cb);\n  // prevent these typical problems:\n  deferred.cb() // synchronous invocation\n  deferred.cb() // multiple invocations\n  deferred.cb() // undefined is not a function (deferred.cb is always defined, even if cb is not)\n}\n```\n\n\n#### Missing Promise Implementation\n\n`promise-resolver` allows you to create API's that provide the convenience of Promises,\n without demanding a bulky Promise polyfill on systems that do not already have an implementation.\n It looks first for `bluebird` and then a native `Promise` implementation.\n\nIf the user does *not* supply a callback *and* no promise implementation is found, an\n error will be thrown explaining how to resolve the problem:\n\n```\n  No Promise Implementation: You must use a callback function, upgrade to Node >= 0.11.13, or install bluebird\n```\n\nIf it does *not* find a promise implementation, but a callback *is* found then it will still return a `deferred`, but \n `deferred.promise` will be `undefined`.\n \nFinally, `promiseResolver.defer(cb, Promise)` does allow you to specify an alternate Promise implementation as the second argument. \n\n\n## API\n \n### promiseResolver.defer(passThrough, Promise)\n\n* `passThrough` - a \"pass through\" node style callback as described above\n* `Promise` - an alternate Promise constructor (will use `bluebird` or native `Promise` implementation by default).\n\nThe return value is a standard `defer` object with an additional `cb` property\nthat is a node style resolver callback.\n \n```js\nvar deferred = promiseResolver(passThroughCallback);\n\n// rejects promise and calls passThroughCallback with same args\ndeferred.cb(new Error('...')); \n\n// resolves promise and calls passThroughCallback with same args\ndeferred. cb(null, 'result'); \n\nreturn deferred.promise;\n```\n\n* `deferred.cb` will resolve/reject the promise and call `passThroughCallback`\n* Ensures that `passThroughCallback` is only called once.\n* If `passThroughCallback` is provided, it is assumed to handle any errors, and so `unhandledRejection` errors on \n  the promise will be suppressed. This avoids potentially confusing console warnings if users are handling errors\n  via a callback and ignoring the returned promise. \n* `deferred.resolve` and `deferred.reject` are also available, and behave as expected.\n* `deferred.promise` will be `undefined` if no Promise implementation is found (in that case `passThroughCallback` is required).\n\n\n### promiseResolver(resolve, reject, passThrough) \n\nAll arguments should be functions, null, or undefined.\n\n* `resolve` - promise resolve function\n* `reject` - promise reject function\n* `passThrough` - a \"pass through\" node style (error first) callback.\n\nReturns a node style callback: `cb(err, result...)`\n\nCalling the callback will resolve or reject the promise (depending on the `err` argument).\nIf it exists, the `passThrough` callback will be called with the same arguments.\n\n```js\nvar promiseResolver = require('promise-resolver');\n\nreturn new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {\n  var cb = promiseResolver(resolve, reject, passThroughCallback);\n  \n  cb(new Error('...'));\n  \n  cb(null, 'result');\n});\n```\n\nThis behaves similar to the `defer` method, with the only exception being that `unhandledRejection` errors are *not* \nautomatically suppressed when `passThroughCallback` is supplied. It also requires you find and invoke the Promise implementation.\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT Â© [James Talmage](http://github.com/jamestalmage)\n","homepage":"https://github.com/jamestalmage/promise-resolver#readme","trustScore":11,"sourceRank":{"basic_info_present":1,"repository_present":1,"readme_present":1,"license_present":1,"versions_present":1,"follows_semver":1,"recent_release":0,"not_brand_new":1,"one_point_oh":1,"dependent_projects":2,"dependent_repositories":1,"stars":0,"contributors":0,"subscribers":0,"all_prereleases":0,"any_outdated_dependencies":0,"is_deprecated":0,"is_unmaintained":0,"is_removed":0,"trustScore":11},"versions":[{"versionNumber":"0.1.0","timestamp":"2015-10-06T21:59:19.030Z","trustScore":5,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.0","timestamp":"2015-10-13T21:26:36.819Z","trustScore":5,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.1.0","timestamp":"2015-10-14T01:27:41.335Z","trustScore":5,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.0","timestamp":"2015-10-18T04:53:56.403Z","trustScore":5,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"native-or-bluebird","version":"^1.2.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"3.0.0","timestamp":"2015-10-19T05:50:32.395Z","trustScore":11,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"native-or-bluebird","version":"^1.2.0"},{"packageName":"safecb","version":"0.0.1"}]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
