The list grows and shrinks as unhandledRejections are published, and later handled.\n\n## Browser Support\n\nThis module can be bundled with `browserify`. At time of writing, it will work with native Promises in the Chrome browser only. For best cross-browser support, use `bluebird` instead of native Promise support in browsers.\n\n## License\n\nMIT Â© [James Talmage](http://github.com/jamestalmage)\n","homepage":"https://github.com/jamestalmage/currently-unhandled#readme","trustScore":20,"sourceRank":{"basic_info_present":1,"repository_present":1,"readme_present":1,"license_present":1,"versions_present":1,"follows_semver":1,"recent_release":0,"not_brand_new":1,"one_point_oh":0,"dependent_projects":4,"dependent_repositories":6,"stars":1,"contributors":0,"subscribers":2,"all_prereleases":0,"any_outdated_dependencies":0,"is_deprecated":0,"is_unmaintained":0,"is_removed":0,"trustScore":20},"versions":[{"versionNumber":"0.3.0","timestamp":"2016-06-02T07:43:51.637Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.4.0","timestamp":"2016-06-02T10:38:52.131Z","trustScore":9,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.4.1","timestamp":"2016-06-02T11:15:15.444Z","trustScore":20,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"array-find-index","version":"^1.0.1"}]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
