That raises\nnew and platform-specific errors and cannot handle long or excessively\nsymlink-looping paths.\n\nThis module handles those cases by detecting the new errors and\nfalling back to the JavaScript implementation.  On versions of Node\nprior to v6, it has no effect.\n\n## USAGE\n\n```js\nvar rp = require('fs.realpath')\n\n// async version\nrp.realpath(someLongAndLoopingPath, function (er, real) {\n  // the ELOOP was handled, but it was a bit slower\n})\n\n// sync version\nvar real = rp.realpathSync(someLongAndLoopingPath)\n\n// monkeypatch at your own risk!\n// This replaces the fs.realpath/fs.realpathSync builtins\nrp.monkeypatch()\n\n// un-do the monkeypatching\nrp.unmonkeypatch()\n```\n","homepage":"https://github.com/isaacs/fs.realpath#readme","trustScore":23,"sourceRank":{"basic_info_present":1,"repository_present":1,"readme_present":1,"license_present":1,"versions_present":1,"follows_semver":1,"recent_release":0,"not_brand_new":1,"one_point_oh":1,"dependent_projects":6,"dependent_repositories":6,"stars":1,"contributors":0,"subscribers":2,"all_prereleases":0,"any_outdated_dependencies":0,"is_deprecated":0,"is_unmaintained":0,"is_removed":0,"trustScore":23},"versions":[{"versionNumber":"0.0.0","timestamp":"2016-06-15T18:38:49.471Z","trustScore":25,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.0","timestamp":"2016-06-15T18:39:05.978Z","trustScore":22,"dependencies":[]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
