Returns a merged stream.\n\n#### `merged.add`\n\nA method to dynamically add more sources to the stream. The argument supplied to `add` can be either a source or an array of sources.\n\n#### `merged.isEmpty`\n\nA method that tells you if the merged stream is empty.\n\nWhen a stream is \"empty\" (aka. no sources were added), it could not be returned to a gulp task.\n\nSo, we could do something like this:\n\n```js\nstream = require('merge-stream')();\n// Something like a loop to add some streams to the merge stream\n// stream.add(streamA);\n// stream.add(streamB);\nreturn stream.isEmpty() ? null : stream;\n```\n\n## Gulp example\n\nAn example use case for **merge-stream** is to combine parts of a task in a project's **gulpfile.js** like this:\n\n```js\nconst gulp =          require('gulp');\nconst htmlValidator = require('gulp-w3c-html-validator');\nconst jsHint =        require('gulp-jshint');\nconst mergeStream =   require('merge-stream');\n\nfunction lint() {\n  return mergeStream(\n    gulp.src('src/*.html')\n      .pipe(htmlValidator())\n      .pipe(htmlValidator.reporter()),\n    gulp.src('src/*.js')\n      .pipe(jsHint())\n      .pipe(jsHint.reporter())\n  );\n}\ngulp.task('lint', lint);\n```\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n","homepage":"https://github.com/grncdr/merge-stream#readme","trustScore":24,"sourceRank":{"basic_info_present":1,"repository_present":1,"readme_present":1,"license_present":1,"versions_present":1,"follows_semver":1,"recent_release":0,"not_brand_new":1,"one_point_oh":1,"dependent_projects":6,"dependent_repositories":5,"stars":2,"contributors":1,"subscribers":2,"all_prereleases":0,"any_outdated_dependencies":0,"is_deprecated":0,"is_unmaintained":0,"is_removed":0,"trustScore":24},"versions":[{"versionNumber":"0.0.0","timestamp":"2013-06-10T03:31:50.008Z","trustScore":22,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.1","timestamp":"2014-05-19T08:56:09.235Z","trustScore":23,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.1","timestamp":"2014-05-20T06:54:55.404Z","trustScore":24,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.2","timestamp":"2014-06-26T21:22:58.499Z","trustScore":27,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"through2","version":"^0.5.1"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.3","timestamp":"2014-07-06T17:52:09.427Z","trustScore":26,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"through2","version":"^0.5.1"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.4","timestamp":"2014-07-06T17:53:03.173Z","trustScore":20,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"through2","version":"^0.5.1"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.5","timestamp":"2014-07-06T17:53:30.302Z","trustScore":22,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"through2","version":"^0.5.1"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.6","timestamp":"2014-09-24T23:58:11.643Z","trustScore":23,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"through2","version":"^0.6.1"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.7","timestamp":"2015-01-10T16:40:44.587Z","trustScore":23,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"through2","version":"^0.6.1"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.8","timestamp":"2015-06-30T21:04:54.555Z","trustScore":25,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"through2","version":"^0.6.1"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.0","timestamp":"2015-08-10T08:21:53.649Z","trustScore":22,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"readable-stream","version":"^2.0.1"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.1","timestamp":"2016-11-25T04:59:57.218Z","trustScore":20,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"readable-stream","version":"^2.0.1"}]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.0","timestamp":"2019-05-23T13:36:45.932Z","trustScore":24,"dependencies":[]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
