Works just like [envify](https://github.com/hughsk/envify) but much faster.\n\n## Gotchas\n\n* Doesn't handle broken syntax.\n* Doesn't look inside embedded expressions in template strings.\n  - **this won't work:**\n  ```js\n  console.log(`the current env is ${process.env.NODE_ENV}`);\n  ```\n* Doesn't replace oddly-spaced or oddly-commented expressions.\n  - **this won't work:**\n  ```js\n  console.log(process./*won't*/env./*work*/NODE_ENV);\n  ```\n\n## Usage/Options\n\nloose-envify has the exact same interface as [envify](https://github.com/hughsk/envify), including the CLI.\n\n## Benchmark\n\n```\nenvify:\n\n  $ for i in {1..5}; do node bench/bench.js 'envify'; done\n  708ms\n  727ms\n  791ms\n  719ms\n  720ms\n\nloose-envify:\n\n  $ for i in {1..5}; do node bench/bench.js '../'; done\n  51ms\n  52ms\n  52ms\n  52ms\n  52ms\n```\n","homepage":"https://github.com/zertosh/loose-envify","trustScore":24,"sourceRank":{"basic_info_present":1,"repository_present":1,"readme_present":1,"license_present":1,"versions_present":1,"follows_semver":1,"recent_release":0,"not_brand_new":1,"one_point_oh":1,"dependent_projects":6,"dependent_repositories":6,"stars":2,"contributors":1,"subscribers":2,"all_prereleases":0,"any_outdated_dependencies":-1,"is_deprecated":0,"is_unmaintained":0,"is_removed":0,"trustScore":24},"versions":[{"versionNumber":"1.0.0","timestamp":"2015-09-21T04:02:42.524Z","trustScore":23,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"js-tokens","version":"^1.0.1"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.1.0","timestamp":"2015-10-18T14:42:18.633Z","trustScore":22,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"js-tokens","version":"^1.0.1"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.2.0","timestamp":"2016-05-15T03:52:10.703Z","trustScore":29,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"js-tokens","version":"^1.0.1"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.3.0","timestamp":"2016-10-28T19:34:32.580Z","trustScore":15,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"js-tokens","version":"^2.0.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.3.1","timestamp":"2017-01-15T13:23:02.230Z","trustScore":21,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"js-tokens","version":"^3.0.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.4.0","timestamp":"2018-07-10T11:09:45.917Z","trustScore":17,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"js-tokens","version":"^3.0.0 || ^4.0.0"}]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
