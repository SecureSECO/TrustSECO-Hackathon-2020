Slices `array` from the `start` index up to, but not including, the `end` index.\n\nPlease consider following this project's author, [Jon Schlinkert](https://github.com/jonschlinkert), and consider starring the project to show your :heart: and support.\n\n## Install\n\nInstall with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):\n\n```sh\n$ npm install --save array-slice\n```\n\nThis function is used instead of `Array#slice` to support node lists in IE < 9 and to ensure dense arrays are returned. This is also faster than native slice in some cases.\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nvar slice = require('array-slice');\nvar arr = ['a', 'b', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j'];\n\nslice(arr, 3, 6);\n//=> ['e', 'f', 'g']\n```\n\n## About\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Contributing</strong></summary>\n\nPull requests and stars are always welcome.
