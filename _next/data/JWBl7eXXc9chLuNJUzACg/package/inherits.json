Alternative\nimplementation is a literal copy of standard one located in standalone\nmodule to avoid requiring of `util`. It also has a shim for old\nbrowsers with no `Object.create` support.\n\nWhile keeping you sure you are using standard `inherits`\nimplementation in node.js environment, it allows bundlers such as\n[browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) to not\ninclude full `util` package to your client code if all you need is\njust `inherits` function. It worth, because browser shim for `util`\npackage is large and `inherits` is often the single function you need\nfrom it.\n\nIt's recommended to use this package instead of\n`require('util').inherits` for any code that has chances to be used\nnot only in node.js but in browser too.\n\n## usage\n\n```js\nvar inherits = require('inherits');\n// then use exactly as the standard one\n```\n\n## note on version ~1.0\n\nVersion ~1.0 had completely different motivation and is not compatible\nneither with 2.0 nor with standard node.js `inherits`.\n\nIf you are using version ~1.0 and planning to switch to ~2.0, be\ncareful:\n\n* new version uses `super_` instead of `super` for referencing\n  superclass\n* new version overwrites current prototype while old one preserves any\n  existing fields on it\n","homepage":"https://github.com/isaacs/inherits#readme","trustScore":25,"sourceRank":{"basic_info_present":1,"repository_present":1,"readme_present":1,"license_present":1,"versions_present":1,"follows_semver":1,"recent_release":0,"not_brand_new":1,"one_point_oh":1,"dependent_projects":6,"dependent_repositories":6,"stars":3,"contributors":0,"subscribers":2,"all_prereleases":0,"any_outdated_dependencies":0,"is_deprecated":0,"is_unmaintained":0,"is_removed":0,"trustScore":25},"versions":[{"versionNumber":"1.0.0","timestamp":"2011-04-07T00:35:15.718Z","trustScore":25,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.0","timestamp":"2013-05-16T14:44:54.523Z","trustScore":24,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.1","timestamp":"2013-08-19T22:10:20.463Z","trustScore":24,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.1","timestamp":"2015-08-26T22:12:12.252Z","trustScore":19,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.2","timestamp":"2015-08-27T19:36:46.817Z","trustScore":24,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.3","timestamp":"2016-09-08T00:49:38.520Z","trustScore":22,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.4","timestamp":"2019-06-19T20:18:52.465Z","trustScore":28,"dependencies":[]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
