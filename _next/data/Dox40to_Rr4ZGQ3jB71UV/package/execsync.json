See [node-gyp installation](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp#installation).\nPre-built binaries for node v0.8 and node v0.10 are packaged. They should work and if not try manually\nbuilding.\n\n    npm install execSync\n\nSometimes a manual build is necessary on Windows even with all the tools in place, replace Visual Studio version\nwith '2010' or '2012' based on the version installed.\n\n    npm install node-gyp -g\n    node-gyp rebuild --msvs_version=2012\n\n## Usage\n\nRequire it\n\n    var sh = require('execSync');\n\n`Run` does not capture output.\n\n    var code = sh.run('echo $USER; echo some_err 1>&2; exit 1');\n    console.log('return code ' + code);\n\nUse the less efficient `exec` if you need output. `exec` is just redirection\ntrickery around `run`.\n\n    var result = sh.exec('echo $USER; echo some_err 1>&2; exit 1');\n    console.log('return code ' + result.code);\n    console.log('stdout + stderr ' + result.stdout);\n\n## Notes\n\nIn *nix and OSX version commands are run via `sh -c YOUR_COMMAND`\n\nIn __Windows__ commands are run via `cmd /C YOUR_COMMAND`\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) 2012, 2013 Mario Gutierrez mario@mgutz.com\n\nSee the file LICENSE for copying permission.\n","homepage":"https://github.com/mgutz/execSync","trustScore":17,"sourceRank":{"basic_info_present":1,"repository_present":1,"readme_present":1,"license_present":1,"versions_present":1,"follows_semver":1,"recent_release":0,"not_brand_new":1,"one_point_oh":1,"dependent_projects":4,"dependent_repositories":3,"stars":2,"contributors":1,"subscribers":0,"all_prereleases":0,"any_outdated_dependencies":-1,"is_deprecated":0,"is_unmaintained":0,"is_removed":0,"trustScore":17},"versions":[{"versionNumber":"0.0.1","timestamp":"2012-06-09T21:57:12.499Z","trustScore":17,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"ffi","version":"~1.0.0"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.2","timestamp":"2013-02-04T05:42:32.663Z","trustScore":17,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"ffi","version":"latest"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.3","timestamp":"2013-02-20T17:28:21.939Z","trustScore":17,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"ffi","version":"latest"}]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.4","timestamp":"2013-04-15T15:34:44.034Z","trustScore":17,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"ffi","version":"latest"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.0-pre","timestamp":"2013-07-12T16:13:19.851Z","trustScore":16,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"temp","version":"~0.5.1"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.1-pre","timestamp":"2013-07-14T17:07:00.692Z","trustScore":15,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"temp","version":"~0.5.1"}]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.2","timestamp":"2014-08-24T16:43:44.429Z","trustScore":16,"dependencies":[{"packageName":"temp","version":"~0.5.1"}]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
