The default behavior is to complete as many copies as possible, logging errors along the way.\n\nIf there are no errors, `ncp` will output `done.` when complete.  If there are errors, the error messages will be logged to `stdout` and to `./ncp-debug.log`, and the copy operation will attempt to continue.\n\n## Programmatic usage\n\nProgrammatic usage of `ncp` is just as simple.  The only argument to the completion callback is a possible error.  \n\n```javascript\nvar ncp = require('ncp').ncp;\n\nncp.limit = 16;\n\nncp(source, destination, function (err) {\n if (err) {\n   return console.error(err);\n }\n console.log('done!');\n});\n```\n\nYou can also call ncp like `ncp(source, destination, options, callback)`. \n`options` should be a dictionary. Currently, such options are available:\n\n  * `options.filter` - a `RegExp` instance, against which each file name is\n  tested to determine whether to copy it or not, or a function taking single\n  parameter: copied file name, returning `true` or `false`, determining\n  whether to copy file or not.\n\n  * `options.transform` - a function: `function (read, write) { read.pipe(write) }`\n  used to apply streaming transforms while copying.\n\n  * `options.clobber` - boolean=true. if set to false, `ncp` will not overwrite \n  destination files that already exist.\n\n  * `options.dereference` - boolean=false. If set to true, `ncp` will follow symbolic\n  links. For example, a symlink in the source tree pointing to a regular file\n  will become a regular file in the destination tree. Broken symlinks will result in\n  errors.\n\n  * `options.stopOnErr` - boolean=false.  If set to true, `ncp` will behave like `cp -r`,\n  and stop on the first error it encounters. By default, `ncp` continues copying, logging all\n  errors and returning an array.\n\n  * `options.errs` - stream. If `options.stopOnErr` is `false`, a stream can be provided, and errors will be written to this stream.\n\nPlease open an issue if any bugs arise.  As always, I accept (working) pull requests, and refunds are available at `/dev/null`.\n","homepage":"https://github.com/AvianFlu/ncp","trustScore":26,"sourceRank":{"basic_info_present":1,"repository_present":1,"readme_present":1,"license_present":1,"versions_present":1,"follows_semver":1,"recent_release":0,"not_brand_new":1,"one_point_oh":1,"dependent_projects":8,"dependent_repositories":5,"stars":3,"contributors":1,"subscribers":1,"all_prereleases":0,"any_outdated_dependencies":0,"is_deprecated":0,"is_unmaintained":0,"is_removed":0,"trustScore":26},"versions":[{"versionNumber":"0.0.0","timestamp":"2011-08-25T00:42:58.122Z","trustScore":29,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.1","timestamp":"2011-08-25T01:16:44.642Z","trustScore":24,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.0.2","timestamp":"2011-08-25T08:55:36.028Z","trustScore":26,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.0","timestamp":"2011-08-26T06:29:36.199Z","trustScore":28,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.1","timestamp":"2011-08-27T05:54:31.461Z","trustScore":29,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.1.2","timestamp":"2011-08-27T21:41:40.327Z","trustScore":27,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.2.0","timestamp":"2011-09-18T03:45:39.737Z","trustScore":23,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.2.1","timestamp":"2011-11-04T07:40:57.523Z","trustScore":22,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.2.2","timestamp":"2011-11-28T17:40:44.763Z","trustScore":26,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.2.3","timestamp":"2011-12-05T18:06:54.822Z","trustScore":26,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.2.4","timestamp":"2012-02-11T22:43:20.005Z","trustScore":29,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.2.5","timestamp":"2012-02-27T16:36:43.254Z","trustScore":26,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.2.6","timestamp":"2012-03-11T20:09:19.561Z","trustScore":25,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.3.0","timestamp":"2013-02-05T13:38:43.020Z","trustScore":22,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.4.0","timestamp":"2013-02-13T17:39:40.689Z","trustScore":23,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.2.7","timestamp":"2013-03-12T16:51:22.908Z","trustScore":28,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.4.1","timestamp":"2013-03-12T16:52:08.349Z","trustScore":26,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.4.2","timestamp":"2013-03-12T17:03:20.086Z","trustScore":25,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.5.0","timestamp":"2013-12-19T17:00:31.273Z","trustScore":26,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.5.1","timestamp":"2014-04-18T15:10:11.827Z","trustScore":27,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"0.6.0","timestamp":"2014-07-08T20:01:55.343Z","trustScore":26,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.0","timestamp":"2014-09-24T14:38:00.986Z","trustScore":26,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"1.0.1","timestamp":"2014-10-02T06:03:54.123Z","trustScore":23,"dependencies":[]},{"versionNumber":"2.0.0","timestamp":"2015-02-22T20:55:26.456Z","trustScore":27,"dependencies":[]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
